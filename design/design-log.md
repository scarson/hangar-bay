# Hangar Bay - Design Decision Log

This document records major design discussion points, considerations, and decisions made throughout the Hangar Bay project, in generally chronological order.

## Initial Phase: Understanding Requirements & ESI (Approx. 2025-06-04 20:00:00-05:00)

*   **Project Goal:** Design a secure e-commerce application for EVE Online ships ("Hangar Bay").
*   **Core Constraint:** Security is paramount due to the EVE Online player base's nature.
*   **Initial Research:** Reviewed EVE Online basics, economy, ships, and the ESI API.
    *   Key finding: ESI API is RESTful, uses SSO, and has cache timers.
    *   ESI Swagger specification reviewed for available endpoints.
*   **Transaction Model Discussion:**
    *   **Consideration:** Can Hangar Bay facilitate transactions directly via ESI?
    *   **ESI Finding:** ESI does *not* allow creating contracts via API.
    *   **Options Considered:**
        1.  Listing platform (manual in-game transactions, Hangar Bay verifies ownership via SSO + asset API).
        2.  Aggregator of public in-game contracts (Hangar Bay displays public contracts, users accept in-game).
    *   **Decision (Memory: d14b4bed): Hangar Bay will be an aggregator of public in-game contracts.**
        *   **Reasoning:** Leverages EVE's existing secure contract system, reducing Hangar Bay's direct involvement in sensitive transaction parts.

## Tech Stack & Core Features Refinement (Approx. 2025-06-04 23:00:00-05:00)

*   **EVE SSO for Value-Add Features:**
    *   **Initial thought:** SSO optional for MVP if just browsing public contracts.
    *   **User Feedback/Decision:** SSO to be a core requirement to enable features like saved searches, watchlists, and configurable alerts. This significantly enhances user value.
*   **Backend Framework Discussion:**
    *   **Options Considered:** Python (FastAPI, Flask) vs. Go.
    *   **FastAPI Pros:** Rapid development, async support, auto-docs, Python ecosystem.
    *   **Go Pros:** Raw performance, concurrency model, static typing.
    *   **Decision: Tentatively Python with FastAPI.**
        *   **Reasoning:** Good balance of performance (especially for I/O bound ESI calls with async) and development speed. User familiarity with C# makes Python's learning curve manageable, and FastAPI's type hints are helpful.
*   **ASGI Server for FastAPI:**
    *   **Initial Spec:** Uvicorn.
    *   **Discussion:** Uvicorn (direct), Hypercorn, Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers.
    *   **Decision: Uvicorn for development, Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers for production.**
        *   **Reasoning:** Gunicorn provides robust process management for production, leveraging Uvicorn's speed.
*   **Database:**
    *   **Options Considered:** PostgreSQL, SQLite for dev.
    *   **Decision: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production.**
        *   **Reasoning:** SQLite for ease of local dev, PostgreSQL for production robustness. An ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) will be used, designing schemas for PostgreSQL capabilities. No dev-to-prod data migration needed; prod schema populated fresh.
*   **Caching Layer:**
    *   **Options Considered:** Redis vs. Valkey (Redis fork).
    *   **Research:** Valkey is community-driven (Linux Foundation), API compatible with Redis 7.2.4 for core needs, open BSD license.
    *   **Decision: Valkey.**
        *   **Reasoning:** Sufficient for caching needs, aligns with open-source preference, good client library compatibility.
*   **Frontend Framework:**
    *   **Options Considered:** React, Vue.js, Angular.
    *   **Decision: Angular.**
        *   **Reasoning:** User interest in learning Angular, comprehensive framework, TypeScript for static typing (potential security/robustness benefits).
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Decision: Application must be containerized (Docker).**
        *   **Reasoning:** Consistency across environments, hosting provider agnosticism, CI/CD integration.

## Specification Documents (Approx. 2025-06-05 00:30:00-05:00)

*   **`design-spec.txt`:** Main design document.
*   **`security-spec.md`:** Created for detailed security guidelines.
    *   **Initial Content:** TLS 1.2/1.3, Perfect Forward Secrecy, PQC aspiration, Encryption at Rest placeholder.
*   **`test-spec.md`:** Created for testing strategy.
*   **`design-log.md`:** This document, for chronological decision tracking.
*   **`observability-spec.md`:** Created for logging, metrics, tracing (distinct from security-specific logs).

## Feature Specification Management (Approx. 2025-06-05 01:46:46-05:00)

*   **Approach:** To facilitate focused development and clear requirements for the Windsurf coding assistant, individual features will be detailed in separate markdown files.
*   **Location:** These feature specifications will reside in the `design/features/` directory.
*   **Template:** A standardized template, `design/features/00-feature-spec-template.md`, has been created to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness across all feature specs.
    *   The template includes sections for overview, user stories, acceptance criteria, scope, data models, API interactions, workflow, UI/UX, error handling, security, performance, dependencies, and notes.
    *   It distinguishes between **Required** and **Optional** sections, with instructions to complete all required sections and evaluate optional ones for applicability.
*   **Process (Memory: e0009aae):** When creating a new feature spec, the `00-feature-spec-template.md` will be referenced. Required sections and applicable optional sections will be copied and filled with feature-specific details.

## Feature Specification Elaboration: F001 & F002 (Approx. 2025-06-05 03:11:17-05:00)

*   **Focus:** Began detailed elaboration of feature specifications, starting with F001 (Public Contract Aggregation & Display) and F002 (Ship Browsing & Advanced Search/Filtering).
*   **F001 (Public Contract Aggregation & Display) Decisions:**
    *   **Data Storage:**
        *   `issuer_name`: Store directly (resolved once at ingestion).
        *   `start_location_name`: Resolve on display (via `start_location_id`).
        *   `esi_type_cache`: Store all `dogma_attributes` and `dogma_effects` (using SQLite JSON1 for dev, PostgreSQL JSONB for prod).
    *   **Error Handling:** For DB errors, implement retry with exponential backoff and jitter.
    *   **Configuration:** EVE regions to poll will be admin-configurable.
    *   **Contract Updates:** Handle updates to existing contracts (e.g., auction prices) via targeted re-fetches based on ESI cache timers and internal refresh intervals, not full re-scans.
*   **F002 (Ship Browsing & Advanced Search/Filtering) Decisions:**
    *   **List View:**
        *   Added user story for basic contract details in list view.
        *   Defined initial fields: Ship Type, Quantity, Total Price, Contract Type, Location, Time Remaining, Issuer Name.
        *   Default sort order: Expiration date (soonest first).
    *   **Advanced Filtering:**
        *   Ship attributes (meta level, tech level): Plan to use `dogma_attributes` from `esi_type_cache`. Requires backend mapping and API enhancements.
        *   Ship categories/groups: Source from ESI Market Groups, cache periodically, and expose via API for UI filters.
*   **Cross-Feature Consistency (Procedural Note):**
    *   After making decisions for F002, F001 was revisited to ensure its data collection and schema would support F002's requirements.
    *   **Updates to F001:**
        *   Added `market_group_id` to `esi_type_cache` for F002 category filtering.
        *   Clarified `contracts.title` usage for F002 keyword search.
        *   Noted a dependency on a separate `location_details_cache` (mapping location IDs to names) to support F002's backend search on location names, as F001 only stores `start_location_id`.
    *   **Rationale:** This iterative refinement ensures that feature specifications remain consistent and that dependencies between features are explicitly identified and addressed in the data-providing features. This process is crucial for robust design.

*(This log will be updated as more decisions are made. Remember to include approximate ISO 8601 timestamps in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ' (U.S. Central Time) for new major decision sections.)*
