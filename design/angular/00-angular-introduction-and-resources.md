# Angular Development: Introduction and AI-Enhanced Resources

This directory (`design/angular/`) houses specific guidelines, best practices, and architectural decisions for the Angular frontend of the Hangar Bay project. Our approach to Angular development is heavily informed by modern Angular standards and, notably, by resources specifically provided by the Angular team to aid AI coding assistants like Cascade.

We aim to build a high-quality, maintainable, and performant application by adhering to these documented practices.

## Key AI-Assist Resources from Angular

The Angular team has provided valuable resources tailored for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI assistants. These serve as a foundational reference for many of the guidelines detailed within this directory:

- **[Using AI for Development (Landing Page)](https://angular.dev/ai/develop-with-ai):** Introduces Angular's initiative to support AI-assisted development.
- **[llms.txt](https://angular.dev/llms.txt):** An index file providing links to key Angular documentation pages, structured for LLM consumption.
- **[llms-full.txt](https://angular.dev/llms-full.txt):** A comprehensive compilation of Angular documentation, formatted in markdown, designed for deep LLM ingestion. This is a primary source for detailed best practices.

## Purpose of This Directory

The documents within `design/angular/` are intended to:

- Provide clear, actionable guidance for both human developers and AI assistants (Cascade).
- Ensure consistency across the Angular codebase.
- Capture project-specific architectural decisions related to the Angular frontend.
- Facilitate onboarding of new team members (human or AI) to our Angular practices.

This structured approach to documentation, combined with Angular's AI-specific resources, will empower Cascade to provide more accurate, context-aware, and high-quality assistance throughout the development lifecycle of the Hangar Bay Angular application.
