# Windsurf Editor using Gemini 2.5 Pro

Hello, I have an idea for an ecommerce site (the "application" or "app") for selling ships in the video game EVE Online. It will be called "Hanger Bay", which is also the name of this project. I would like your assistance in creating a design specification ("design spec") for the application. The design spec should be structured to be a highly effective input into Windsurf / Cascade to use to write the application code once it's complete. We will work through aspects of the application architecture and design together. I have a some programming and software architecture experience and can make decisions if provided with high quality information to inform them. However, do not be hesitant to have strong opinions in design areas if they can be justified. I have not decided on any specific tech stack for this app. I pre-created an empty design spec markdown file for us to use, which can be found at path "C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\design-spec.txt"

Before doing anything else, create a memory emphasizing that SECURITY IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT for this application. EVE Online players, the target audience for Hangar Bay, are known for their ingenuity in exploiting systems. Theft, deceit, extortion, hacking, and scheming are considered legitimate parts of the EVE Online metagame.. This app will be targeted. Parties with malicious intent will try to exploit the app in every possible way. WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN. There must be NO tradeoffs where security is sacrificed for features or convenience. Security must be an overriding concern in every applicable design and implementation area. AT ABSOLUTE MINIMUM, THE APPLICATION MUST TAKE EXTREME PRECAUTIONS AGAINST (1) ALL OWASP TOP 10 WEB APPLICATION SECURITY RISKS AND (2) USE LEADING/BEST SECURE CODING PRACTICES FOR ALL LANGUAGES, FRAMEWORKS, AND TECHOLOGIES USED IN THE APP. Proactively think through potential attack vectors and risks for the application and aggressively eliminate them by design or implement effective mitigations wherever possible. Where attack vectors and risks cannot be effectively eliminated by design or mitigated, extensively think through possible alternatives, and if no alternatives are feasible, document the risk as clearly as possible. The design spec should have a Security section, and all other sections must include a reference to the Security section with instructions to consider it part of their spec too.

We will start the process by having you learn about EVE so we can have a more informed design dialog afterward.

First, review these links to learn about EVE in general:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online
* https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon - this will teach you EVE terminology you might find in subsequent articles
* https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Getting_Started_in_EVE_Online
* https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy

Then, review these articles about the modern EVE API called "ESI" that we will use to get ship pricing and other such market information from the game:
* https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/eve-evolved-the-future-of-eves-api
* https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/introducing-esi
* https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/introducing-the-esi-api
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/overview/ - official developer documentation landing page
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/best-practices/ - official developer documentation - best practices
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/sso/ - official developer documentation - single sign-on guidance
* https://esi.evetech.net/ui/ - ESI API Swagger UI / OpenAPI spec

There is a 3rd party site that has some of the fuctionality we're interested in called EVE Market Browser. You can review it here:
* https://evemarketbrowser.com/region/

After reviewing all this, think about if there's any additional information you might want before starting our design discussion and bring it up if so. 


----------------


1. You raise great points with "User Authentication (EVE SSO): While not strictly required for users to browse public contracts (which are, by definition, public), EVE SSO could still be valuable for:
* Allowing users to save searches or create watchlists for specific ships or contract types.
* Potentially allowing users to see their own public contracts highlighted if they choose to log in.
* We can consider SSO an optional feature for enhanced user experience, rather than a core requirement for the MVP."

I think allowing users to save searches and create watchlists for specific ships or contract types would be a core value-add feature of the app, so let's make this a requirement. With regards to watchlists, users should be able to set up alerts to be notified when configurable watchlist criteria are met (for example, a contract for a desired ship is available below a specified price threshold).

2. Backend framework: I would like to consider Python vs Go in more depth. My high-level understanding of Go is that it's designed for high performance, API-driven web applications and has highly opinionated security defaults. I have a little familiarity with Python from years ago but am most experienced with C#. That doesn't mean I want to use a .NET stack. Rather, I'm interested in how my C# / .NET experience might translate to Python or Go.

3. Database: For the purposes of rapid prototyping and keeping things more self-contained, I'm interested in using SQLite during development. If we did that, how much risk and complexity would likely be involved in switching over to PostgreSQL later on?

4. Caching layer: Redis recently had a major open source fork called Valkey. While largely the same code, they have now diversed somewhat in features. Please perform an assessment of the latest available versions of Redis (8.0.2) and Valkey (8.1.1) in the context of which may be better suited for this project. If there are no applicable functional differences, prefer Valkey. Here are some resources I found on the internet that might serve as starting points for your research:
* https://redis.io/blog/what-is-valkey/ 
* https://betterstack.com/community/comparisons/redis-vs-valkey/
* https://www.dragonflydb.io/blog/redis-8-0-vs-valkey-8-1-a-technical-comparison
* https://dimasyotama.medium.com/valkey-vs-redis-the-fork-awakens-understanding-the-split-key-differences-and-implementation-89c0123403eb
* https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/what-is-valkey/
* https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey
* https://valkey.io/topics/

5. Frontend framework: Consider Angular as another alternative as I have an interest in learning it. What are the pros and cons vs React and Vue.js?

6. Deployment: I agree the app must be able to be containerized for deployment. This should be done in way agnostic to hosting provider like AWS or Azure to keep our options open. Let's make sure this is an explicit requirement in the design spec.

7. Because security is paramount and there will be many security-related details that are too specific for the more general principles in the design spec, I've created a separate markdown file called "C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\security-spec.md". We'll call this the "security spec". Use this file to document important security considerations that are more detailed than appropriate for the design spec. For example, specific guideslines for Flask or other technologies, DoS prevention techniques relevant to the app, standards for secure handling of auth tokens and secrets, etc. UPDATE AND REFERENCE THIS FILE AS NEEDED TO HELP FULFILL THE SECURITY OBJECTIVES.

Start by populating the security spec with information that is or will likely be relevant to the app. All data must be encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2 or 1.3, using only cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy. If there are opportunities to use NIST-approved quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, we should do so unless there are significant downsides. After making those updates, update your SECURITY IS PARAMOUNT memory to include the security spec file.


---------------


1. User Authentication (EVE SSO), Watchlists, and Alerts:
Great. Please think about other high value-add features the app could potentially have now that EVE SSO is a foundational requirement. Try to identify low hanging fruit - features that could add meaningful value for users without significant scope creep or increases in implementation complexity, staying within the ship-centric focus of Hangar Bay. Eve Market Browser already exists and it'd be good to have some competitive differentiators. 

2. Backend Framework: Python (FastAPI) vs. Go
I'm sold on starting with Python/FastAPI. Let's tentatively spec it for now.

2.1 I see you've specified Uvicorn as the ASGI server for FastAPI. I skimmed this article, which mentions a key takeaway of "ASGI Servers: Choose the right ASGI server (Uvicorn, Hypercorn, or Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers) based on your specific needs.":
https://medium.com/@ramanbazhanau/preparing-fastapi-for-production-a-comprehensive-guide-d167e693aa2b (if you cannot read the full article online due the Medium paywall, let me know and I will save it as a PDF and provide the file)
What might we consider about other ASGI server options before solidifying this decision?

3. Database: SQLite for Development, PostgreSQL for Production
I like the proposed ORM approach. Let's make sure to use an ORM and design our schemas and queries with PostgreSQL capabilities in mind. Add this to the design spec. We will not need to actually migrate data from SQLite to PostgreSQL. We'll deploy the schema and populate it with fresh data from appropriate sources. 

4. Caching Layer: Redis vs. Valkey
Thanks for the assessment. Let's spec Valkey based on your findings.

5. Frontend Framework: Angular vs. React vs. Vue.js
Let's go with Angular. While the simplicity of Vue.js is appealing, I like TypeScript's static typing (which I think can help us avoid type errors that could impact security) and there is significant value to me in learning Angular better.

7. I agree with your assessment of the current state of PQC. Let's keep that aspirational as you've indicated in the security spec. However, please add an encryption at rest subsection of Cryptography. We should make sure to encrypt sensitive data at rest and consider approaches for this, which may be different for various parts of the app. Note that the best thing for data security is to not store sensitive data you don't need to hold onto in the first place, as you can't lose what you don't have. We should not retain any more data than is necessary to provide application functions.

8. In the database response, you mentioned a test suite. A robust test strategy and suite is very important. Let's make sure we're adding methodical, useful test coverage from the beginning. Please create a test-spec.md file (the "test spec") alongside the security and design specs and populate it with relevant information so far. Add placeholders where appropriate to update later once relevant details are known.

9. We're starting to make a lot of design decisions. I saw you mentioned some Reasoning and Alternatives Considered points in the design spec, which is fantastic, but I'd also like to keep a separate chronological record of major design discussion points, considerations, and decisions made. Let's call this the "design decision log", or "design log" for short. Please create design-log.md in the same directory as the design spec. Update it with all the major design discussion points, considerations, and decisions made so far, in generally chronological order. Ultimately, a person should be able to read it and come away with the "story" of how this design process developed. After populating the initial design log, create a memory for it, and continue to update the design log throughout the project whenever appropriate.

10. The Preparing FastAPI for Production: A Comprehensive Guide also lists as a key point: "Logging and Monitoring: Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring to gain insights into your application’s behavior and quickly identify issues."
Because we are security focused and as a matter of general good practice, let's make sure that we build in observability with logging and monitoring from the beginning. This should apply to the application as a whole, not just FastAPI. Please create a observability-spec.md file ("observ spec" for short) in the same directory as the design spec. This observ spec is focused primarily on observability, rather than the Security event logging, audit trails, intrusion detection/prevention in the Logging and Monitoring section of the security spec. Populate it with relevant information so far. Add placeholders where appropriate to update later once relevant details are known. Then update the design spec to include references to the logging spec wherever appropriate. However, if you think this is extraneous and has too much overlap with the design and security specs, please raise that concern so we can discuss the best way to ensure observability considerations are addressed throughout the project. 

Let's address the items above before proceeding with detailing some of the other sections in the design and security specs.


---------------


1. I realize I'd intended to have the design spec be a markdown file like the others, but accidentally specified a .txt extension. Please copy its contents to a new design-spec.md file, apply markdown formatting like the other specs docs, verify that all the content is the same aside from the markdown formatting, then delete the design-spec.txt file. Then update any relevant memories to reference the new design-spec.md file instead of the old design-spec.txt.

2. In the design log, please add a timestamp to each section block based on your knowledge of the system timestamps for your own responses. Record the datetimes in ISO 8601 format with the U.S. Central time zone. Update the "*(This log will be updated as more decisions are made.)*" note with an instruction to yourself to include these timestamps going forward.

3. In the design spec, make a note in an appropriate location to further detail user notification mechanisms for watchlist and other alerts. We will presumably need an SMTP email integration of some sort. However, it would also be interesting to know if the ESI API provides any methods to send in-game notifications to players.

4. As these individual feature areas get more implementation details, we may want to capture those in individual feature spec markdown files to facilitate Windsurf using them as references when writing and reviewing the related code. We could create a "features" directory within the existing "design" project directory to organize and store these files. What do you think of this approach? How could it be improved to better facilitate effective use of the Windsurf (with Gemini Pro 2.5) coding assistant? I'm very open to other ideas, so if you have any that could help accomplish this objective, please propose them.


---------------


1. In the design log, the timestamps are in the format "2025-06-04T23:00:00-05:00". For easier reading, please remove the "T" that appears before the time section and replace it with a space. Update the instruction at the end of the document to reflect this updated timestamp format.

2. I love your feedback on the feature spec details. Let's start by creating a template feature spec that contains those key elements that make them useful to AI coding assistants and beyond. Please first create the "features" directory, then create a "00-feature-spec-template.md" markdown file (we'll refer to it as the "feature spec template") and populate it with all the sections you proposed. Try to think of others that might be helpful as well. It's okay if some are only conditionally applicable, like API Endpoints Involved. Mark each section as Required or Optional. Make sure the feature spec template includes an instruction to always include Required sections, and evaluate each Optional section for applicability. When we create a new feature spec, start by looking at the feature spec template, assessing each Optional section for applicability, and then copying over all the Required and applicable Optional sections. If you have any enhancements to that procedure that could make the process more effective please propose them. Then, create a memory for feature creation that captures this feature spec template reference, assessment, and copying process.


---------------


1. Please update the design log with our approach for feature spec management.

2. For the observability spec, let's prefer OpenTelemetry compatible options wherever possible. Update the spec as appropriate.

3. I want you to review the design spec, identify features that should have their own feature spec, then create initial feature specs for each one with the information we have available so far. As we're still in the design stage, when you create these feature specs, explicitly note where additional information, discussion, and/or decision points are required in each feature spec section. 

4. After creating the initial feature specs, we should prioritize which to work on first. One idea for this is to see which feature or features are common dependencies for others. That might suggest we should work on them first, since their details may have downstream impacts on other features that depend on them. However, there may be other good ways to prioritize what to work on first and I'm very open to any alternative ideas you have.


---------------


Let's go through some of the [NEEDS_DISCUSSION] / [NEEDS_DECISION] items, by feature, starting with F001.

F001:
5. Key Data Structures / Models: 
* For "issuer_name", store the name. Changing character names is an uncommon and difficult task in EVE that requires opening a formal support request. For this reason, there's likely little value in making an extra call to resolve the name on display. 
* For "start_location_name", resolve on display.
* I am still unsure about "volume"
* For the esi_type_cache table, we should store all dogma_attribute and dogma_effects. We don't know which might be relevant to users, this isn't sensitive information so there isn't a security issue storing it, and there are a relatively small number of ships to store data for in the context of a modern database. However, I do see this is a JSONB type. Does SQLite support JSONB?

9. Error Handling & Edge Cases (Required)
* For "[NEEDS_DISCUSSION: Retry strategy for DB errors]" - Please research common database retry strategies that are applicable to PostgreSQL, since we'll be using that for Production. Then add details for the strategies that seem appropriate for Hanger Bay's architecture.
* For "[FURTHER_DETAIL_REQUIRED: More specific edge cases related to contract types (auction vs. item_exchange), item types, etc.]" - we'll deal with these later when we understand the contract types better.

13. Notes / Open Questions
* For "[NEEDS_DECISION: Which EVE regions to poll by default? Should this be configurable by an admin?]" this should be configurable. For prototyping we'll likely want to set that configuration to only one or two regions but it's important that region selection by admins is flexible.
* For "[NEEDS_DISCUSSION: How to handle updates to existing contracts if ESI data changes before expiration (e.g., auction price changes)? Re-fetch items and update, or rely on full periodic re-scans?]" - Full scans sound expensive. However, with the re-fetch and update approach, how would we know when to update?

Please discuss and update the feature spec accordingly.


---------------


F002:
2. User Stories
* [FURTHER_DETAIL_REQUIRED: User story for viewing basic contract details in the list view.] - What details are required to write this user story? Start by checking Check EVE Market Browser (https://evemarketbrowser.com/region/), assessing the basic contract details it shows in its list view, and using those as our default set. That's a popular service with players and presumably provides a good starting point for what fields are useful.

13. Notes / Open Questions
* [NEEDS_DECISION: Specific fields to include in the list view for each contract.] - Let's use the fields from the ship page(s) of EVE Market Browser as our starting point. 
* [NEEDS_DECISION: Default sort order.] - Check EVE Market Browser for its default sort order as well. We'll start with that.
* [NEEDS_DISCUSSION: How to handle filtering by ship attributes (e.g., meta level, tech level) if desired in the future? Requires more detailed `esi_type_cache` and backend logic.] - This more advanced filtering would be good to have the capabilities for. Please expand on the more detailed esi_type_cashe and backend logic that might be required to support this.
* [NEEDS_DISCUSSION: Exact list of filterable ship categories/groups. Should this be dynamic based on available data or a fixed list?] - Check the EVE Market Browser implementation and see if their approach can be determined. If not, is the list of ships available through the ESI API? If it's available through the API, as ship categories probably don't change very often, we could probably do something like poll ESI for the list once per hour or day and cache the response in a fixed list to use with the site. That would dramatically reduce the number of calls required to maintain the list while still keeping it reasonably fresh.


---------------


Let's move to F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md

First, assess if there is anything we can initially update in F003 based on our updates to F001 and F002. Then proceed with acting on this feedback:

F003:
13. Notes / Open Questions
* [NEEDS_RESEARCH: How to best display ship attributes from `dogma_attributes`? Select key ones or show all? Formatting?] - Is there anything you can tell from EMB to help inform this? If you can't, because UI space is limited, let's take the approach of displaying some key ones with some method of expanding the display to show more or all.
* [NEEDS_DECISION: If a contract contains multiple items (e.g., a ship and some modules), how are non-ship items displayed, if at all, on this *ship* contract view? Current assumption is F001 filters for *primarily* ship contracts.] - Let's take the approach of flagging these "mixed" contracts with a boolean property if we're not already. This would enable setting an indicator for when other items are in the contract. If it's easy to list the names and quantities of those non-ship items, we should do so. However, I think we should avoid trying to display more properties than name and quantity because that could very quickly increase the complexity and ESI API surface and data schema we need to deal with. That said, there may be some specific item categories that are frequently paired with ships, like Modules, it would be useful to have handling for because users might value that information. 
* [NEEDS_RESEARCH: Availability and usage of EVE Online's image server for ship renders (e.g., `https://images.evetech.net/types/{type_id}/render?size=512`).] - Please provide guidance on the research task(s) to move this item forward, conduct them yourself if possible, and then update the item.

After addressing the F003 items, please assess if there is anything we should go back and update in F001 and F003 given these decisions in F003.


---------------


It occurred to me that many potential users might want to access the Hanger Bay site on their phones. While modern web frameworks are generally device responsive, we should explicitly include "Mobile friendly design" in the main design-spec.md. Think about how best to structure the "mobile friendly design" entry in the context of being useful to an AI coding assistant, then update design-spec.md with it in an appropriate location. Then, update test-spec.md to include mentions of testing for different display formats (e.g., desktop vs mobile) in an appropriate location.


---------------


I'm glad you mentioned accessibility and I see the "**Accessibility (A11y):** All accessibility principles (WCAG AA as a minimum target) apply equally to mobile views. Ensure ARIA attributes are used correctly for dynamic content and custom controls." item in the "Mobile-Friendly and Responsive Design (Core Requirement)" section of design-spec.md. This is the first explicit mention of accessibility principles I've seen. Accessibility is critically important in software design and genuinely makes the world a kinder, more welcoming place for everyone. This should be captured in a new \design\accessibility-spec.md file. The accessibility spec should be structured in the context of being useful to an AI coding assistant ensuring accessibility requirements are always met while developing the application. The spec should state WCAG AA as a minimum target, and include sections relevant to any technologies used in the application's tech stack, with a focus on frontend technologies. Please include any other modern accessibility principles that could apply to Hanger Bay. 

Then, update design-spec.md to incorporate accessibility-spec.md by reference in any applicable sections, just like with security-spec.md.

Then, update test-spec.md to incorporate accessibility testing in any applicable sections.

Then, update the design-log with a new entry about the mobile friendly design and accessiblity updates.

Then, stage and prepare git commits for design-log.md, design-spec.md, test-spec.md, and accessibility-spec.md.


---------------


Before we proceed, please review all current spec files (which is all files except design-log.md) for potential enhancements in the context of making them more useful to an AI coding assistant. Propose any enhancements, describing in detail why you think they could make the specs more effective for an AI coding assistant. design-spec.md still has an important role for human reviewer understanding the project, so take special care to preserve human readability for the design spec. 

Then, for any changes you are confident will make the specs more useful to an AI coding assistant, implement the changes. 

Then, update design-log.md with a new entry describing the changes.


----------------


I have reviewed the changes. Very impressive! I have a single feedback point.

In security-spec.md 1.1 Encryption in Transit, please update the new "Ensure backend to PostgreSQL calls use TLS if over a non-trusted network." item to "Ensure backend to PostgreSQL calls use TLS". We should encrypt all data in transit. Network boundaries do not provide security guarantees and we should follow the modern security practice of an "assume breach" threat posture and zero-trust principles. These principles have broader importance beyond just PostgreSQL encryption in transit. Please also add references to zero-trust principles in an appropriate location or locations within security-spec.md.

After updating security-spec.md, please prepare git commits for all the changed files with that good commit message.


----------------


Before we move onto coding, we have four more features, F004, F005, F006, and F007 to review. We should do that next. Before we proceed, please update all relevant project memories.


----------------


I am greatly enjoying our collaboration on this project so far and feel it has been mutually beneficial. I would like you to perform a comprehensive, honest assessment of all the feedback I've provided so far. As part of this, please provide an honest assessment of what you think my software engineering and design skill level is, and areas of strength and weakness (i.e., room for improvement. Then, provide your honest feedback on my own feedback, with a specific focus on recommendations and observations that could help me work even more effectively with you going forward. Remember, the goal of this review is to help us work better together.


----------------


Thanks for the helpful feedback! It gave me an idea. Could you please create a new "design\instruction-recs.md" file for the purpose to documenting clear, practical recommendations on crafting prompt instructions for AI coding assistant in both general and specific scenarios within the Hangar Bay project? Its primary purpose will be for human reference, but the information within could be useful for AIs as well. For that reason, prioritize utility to humans for this file and include a specific note within it to document that instruction, since nearly everywhere else will prioritize utility to AI coding assistants. Use your "Recommendations for Even More Effective Collaboration Going Forward" from the assessment as a starting point.

After creating that file, update design-log.md with a new entry documenting both my request for an honest assessment of my feedback and the new instruction-recs.md file that came as a result of that assessment.


----------------


I realized we would benefit from one more general spec before proceeding with features. That spec is forn internationalization, often referred to as "i18n". 
1. Think about why internationalization is important in software development, especially for a public web service like Hangar Bar. While Hangar Bay's primary language will be English, it's important that we build in i18n capabilities from the beginning so the app is accessible to international markets.
2. Think about how and what i18n principles and implementation guidance could apply to Hangar Bay and our chosen tech stack. 
3. Think about how those i18n items might interact with other design specs, such as (but not limited to) accessibility-spec.md.
4. Then, create a new i18n spec file \design\i18n-spec.md and populate it as appropriate based on the earlier steps. The i18n spec should be structured in the context of being useful to an AI coding assistant ensuring internationalization requirements are always met while developing the application.
5. After creating i18n-spec.md, review it for potential improvements, especially those that would help an AI coding assistant during implementation of this project, and make those changes.
6. Then, update design-spec.md to include i18n as and where appropriate, and add references to the i18n-spec.md in areas you assess as relevant, like we've done with the other topic-specific design specs.
7. Finally, update design-log.md with a new entry to reflect the inclusion of i18n in the project.


----------------


A few notes:
1. In i18n-spec.md, section "3.1. Backend (FastAPI)", you specify using fastapi-babel and pybabel for i18n support. In your thought process earlier, you also mention python-i18n. Why did you select Babel? Please compare the options in the context of their suitability for the Hangar Bay project. 

2. In i18n-spec.md, section 3.3. "Data Handling (ESI vs. Application-Specific)", you say "If ESI does not support a user's selected locale for a specific endpoint/data, fall back gracefully to a default language (e.g., `en-us`) from ESI.". Let's explicitly make "en-us" the default language. Update any mentions of an example default language to clearly state that the default language is "en-us" and record that decision anywhere appropriate where it would be helpful to an AI coding assistant. 

3. In design-spec.md, you made changes to section 10. UI/UX Considerations that removed many mobile-related items in favor of i18n ones. Why did that happen?
3.1 For reference here is the removed text. Please careful review it, identify important items and details, and then make a corrective update to the 10. UI/UX Considerations section that includes those as well as the i18n items:

        *   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize assets (images, scripts, styles) for faster loading on mobile networks. Consider techniques like lazy loading for images and non-critical components.
        *   **Readability:** Ensure text is legible across all screen sizes with appropriate font sizes, line heights, and contrast ratios.
        *   **AI Action: Accessibility:** Design and implement with accessibility in mind from the start. Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. Refer to `accessibility-spec.md` for detailed requirements and ensure Angular Material/CDK accessibility features are leveraged.
        *   **Progressive Enhancement/Graceful Degradation:** Design with a mobile-first approach or ensure graceful degradation so core functionality remains accessible on less capable devices or browsers.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test on various emulated mobile viewports (using browser developer tools) and, where possible, on a range of real mobile devices. (Refer to `test-spec.md` for detailed testing requirements).
*   **AI Action: Minimalism and Focus:** Design UIs that avoid clutter. Present only relevant information and actions to the user to maintain focus on the core tasks.
*   **AI Action: Performance and Responsiveness:** Ensure the application loads quickly and responds promptly to user interactions. Implement optimized data loading and rendering strategies. See `performance-spec.md` (to be created).
*   **AI Action: Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language (colors, typography, layout, component behavior) throughout the application, leveraging Angular Material theming.
*   **AI Action: Error Handling and Feedback:** Implement clear, user-friendly error messages and feedback mechanisms for user actions (e.g., loading indicators, success/failure notifications using snackbars or toasts).
*   **AI Action: Trust and Security Cues:** Visually reinforce trust and security in the UI elements, especially around authentication and user data sections. Use iconography and language that conveys security.

4. In "3. Interaction with Other Design Specs", you raised relevant interactions with accessibility-spec.md and test-spec.md. Please update those files with the points you raised in the appropriate areas, and explicitly cross-reference i18n-spec.md in them. Be careful not to lose important details in those specs, like happened in design-spec.md as detailed above.

5. In design-log.md retroactively update the "Internationalization Specification Integration" entry to mention updates to the accessibility-spec.md and test-spec.md files. Also add another sentence to the rationale discussing EVE Online's global player base as a consideration for the importance of i18n for Hangar Bay.


----------------


Great job on the i18n items and corrections. Let's prepare a git commit for the i18n related updates to the new and updated spec.md files.

After that commit, here's the next item to work on:
In design-spec.md, section 10. UI/UX Considerations, you have item:
*   **AI Action: Performance and Responsiveness (General):** Ensure the application loads quickly and responds promptly to user interactions. Implement optimized data loading and rendering strategies. (See `performance-spec.md`, to be created).

Let's discuss that performance-spec.md. Please explain how or why having a separate performance could be helpful. Consider if there's any way it could be detrimental, such as by duplicating information in a way that could potentially confuse an AI coding assistant. Think through pros and cons. If you determine having a performance-spec.md would be beneficial to the project, carefully think through what would be most helpful to an AI coding assistant to include in it, then create the file and write the performance spec with a general structure similar to the other design spec files.


----------------


Before we commit anything. I see performance-spec.md references several other *-spec.md files. Please check each of those spec files and update them as appropriate with information and cross-references to the new performance-spec.md. In design-spec.md, I see a single new entry of "**AI Action: Performance and Responsiveness (General):**" - consider if there are any other areas of design-spec.md where it would benefit an AI coding assistant to have performance-spec.md mentioned.

Then, in design-log.md, retroactively update the"Performance Specification Creation" entry to reflect changes to any other spec files related to performance-spec.md.

Then, update the README.md in the project root to reflect information about the i18n and performance spec updates.

Then prepare the commit.


----------------


An important note. This project is published to a public Github repository. File paths in spec.md and other files must NEVER contain full absolute paths, which reveal my name and local file structure. They must ALWAYS use relative paths to the project root. Create a memory to capture this important instruction.

Next, I saw you made this good update:
"Update design/features/00-feature-spec-template.md: Add performance considerations and references to performance-spec.md."
Updating 00-feature-spec-template.md was a good idea because it's the basis for all our feature specs. I looked at it and didn't see the i18n-spec.md we recently created mentioned. This is a good time to do a careful review of 00-feature-spec-template.md to make it as useful as possible for an AI coding assistant, like evaluating where using the "**AI Assistant Guidance:**" and similar instructions we discussed that would be helpful to AI coding assistant would provide value. Then, make any updates to it referencing our expanded set of design\*-spec.md spec files that would be beneficial to an AI coding assistant. Not all specs will be always be applicable, so remember that you can use tags like "Optional" and "Required" to provide contextual hints. 

After updating 00-feature-spec-template.md, we should review feature specs F001 - F007 and align them with the updated 00-feature-spec-template.md. You must do this review EXTREMELY CAREFULLY and one feature spec file at a time. Be absolutely sure to not lose ANY important information when you make changes. Also take this opportunity to look for any areas where the feature spec could be enhanced to be more useful to AI coding assistants. Review your own work against these criteria and provide an assessment. Only once you're confident the feature spec is aligned in relevant ways with the 00-feature-spec-template.md for consistency, retained all important information, and is structured to be as helpful as possible to an AI coding assistant can you proceed to working on the next feature spec.


----------------


1. Update security-spec.md to include that user-facing error messages must never reveal sensitive information or internal service details in accordance with secure coding best practices. Put this in an appropriate section. 

2. Should we update 00-feature-spec-template.md to include links to the ESI API swagger / OpenAPI definition and developer documentation as a context hint since many features will leverage that API. Would having the link to the authoriative source potentially help prevent an AI assistant from hallucinating ESI API details or otherwise be helpful? If so, explain why, then determine if you have the information you need to make that to update 00-feature-spec-template.md. If not, let me know what information you need and I'll get it for you. 

3 Is there any risk you've hallucinated ESI API details in any of the feature specs so far? In the recent updates to the feature spec files to align them with the updated 00-feature-spec-template.md, it looks like you added a LOT of ESI API details in features that deal with that API. Have you been using the authoritative ESI API reference to construct those? It's better to identify any errors now rather than during implementation. Please carefully review, reporting your findings, and make any correction if necessary.

4. In the "Dependencies" section of each F001 - F007 feature spec.md document, other features are referenced only by their feature number (e.g., "F001"). To make this section more useful to an AI assistant, please update each feature dependency reference to include the actual feature spec file, like we've done with the design spec.md files.

5. In this chat, I see tool call output from you like "Analyzed F007-Alerts-Notifications.md:(1-200)" that seems to indicate you ingest file text in 200 line chunks. Is that true? What happens if a file has more than 200 lines? Help me understand practical considerations for maximizing effectiveness working with you and Windstream. Should we try to keep spec files under 200 lines? Does our spec file structure with clear sections explicitly designed to help AI coding assistants mitigate this? Is there anything else I should be aware of or consider in this area?


----------------


It looks like you proceeded with the API hallucination review before I'd provided the authoritative API reference and developer resource links.
You requested the following information:
"Information Needed: To make this update, I need the official URLs for:
The ESI Swagger/OpenAPI specification (this is often a .json or .yaml file, or a URL to a Swagger UI instance).
The main ESI developer documentation portal/website."

Here are links. 
* https://esi.evetech.net/ui/ - ESI API Swagger UI / OpenAPI spec
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/overview/ - official developer documentation landing page
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/best-practices/ - official developer documentation - best practices
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/sso/ - official developer documentation - single sign-on guidance

For the link, in the "Why it's helpful:" section of your response, you said:
"Focused AI Prompts: You can explicitly direct an AI assistant to "refer to the linked ESI Swagger definition at [link] to confirm the request/response schema for endpoint X" when generating implementation details."
Is that something it could be helpful to integrate into our feature spec template and existing feature specs as an AI Actionable Checklist item (or similar instruction) for ESI API-related items? If so, please update 00-feature-spec-template.md with that change along with the API links.


----------------


Before we proceed with reviewing and aligning the existing feature specs (F001-F007) with this updated template, I've noticed you're consistently having trouble with expected vs actual names for the feature spec files and having to run partial match searches to find them. Would having a /design/features/feature-index.md file that simply contained list mapping feature ID like "F001" to feature name and the feature spec.md file path? The property names can align with those in the feature spec files. For example, in table format:
Feature ID, Feature Spec, Feature Spec Path
F005, Saved Searches, .\F005-Saved-Searches.md

Please carefully consider if something like this would be useful to you, or if there's a better way to address the issue. It you think it would be  helpful, consider if there's any way the feature-index.md file could be enhanced to be more useful to an AI assistant, and create the file with those in mind.


-----------------


1. I'm glad we have the feature-index.md file now. However, I'm wondering how we can keep it consistently updated as we add and modify features without a human having to manually prompt to update it every time. Can you propose and implement any solutions? One idea I had is for you to create a memory to check if any feature-index.md updates are appropriate whenever we create new feature specs or update existing ones. You might have better ideas though. Having the most effective solution is the most important.

2. Update design-log.md with a new entry describing the feature-index.md file, the thought process behind it, the problem it solves, and our strategy for keeping it updated by the AI coding assistant (you).


-----------------


1. I think "memory (ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6) detailing a procedure for you (the AI coding assistant) to help keep design/features/feature-index.md updated. This procedure involves checking for changes after feature spec modifications, extracting relevant metadata, and proposing updates to you for feature-index.md." is a critical evolution in us working effectively together towards bringing the Hangar Bay project to fruition. 

2. I think it's critically important that we document procedures like this one in a persistent manner, both to keep a record and learn from. We should keep a record of such procedures, including the problem they attempt to address, the detailed thoughts that went into their creation, and their implementation details, structured with sufficient specificity to be easily recreated in a different project. We could keep these records in a well-structured markdown file like "\design\ai-system-procedures.md". What do you think? How could this idea be executed in the most effective way? While as always we want it to be as useful as possible to AI coding assistants because they may need to re-implement procedures from this record, it's important humans can learn from it too. 
Please:
* carefully think through the matter of recording this type of AI coding assistant procedure
* propose an approach to address it
* critically evaluate your proposal and assess it for areas of improvement
* update the proposal if and as appropriate
* implement it
* add a new entry to design-log.md describing what you implemented, the type of procedure we're capturing with this record in categorical terms, the rationale for recording them, and why the ai-system-procedures.md (whatever the file is named) file contains the information it does


-----------------


I have an idea to try a test of "design\ai-system-procedures.md" to assess the "Reproducibility: The level of detail should allow for understanding and potential re-implementation." criteria. Here's my idea:
* You read "design\ai-system-procedures.md"
* Create a temp memory based on the specification and details for AISP-001 in the document. You'll delete the temp memory after the test.
* Compare that tempo memory to memory ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6, the original one you used to write the AISP-001 specification
* Identify any differences, gaps, or deficiencies between the two memories
* If there are any, critically think about why they occurred. 
* You mentioned "Complexity of "Detailed Steps": Finding the right balance between sufficient detail for AI and avoiding excessive rigidity is key. The steps should outline what to do and key decisions, rather than scripting every single token of an AI's thought process." as a consideration. If differences reasonably fall within that "right balance" area, there isn't necessarily any action we should take.
* Comprehensively report back before taking any actions to modify "design\ai-system-procedures.md"

1. What do you think of this testing idea? Would it be effective? Why or why not? If not, how could it be improved? For example, would you recent context window interfere with the test to the point of making it invalid for assessment. It's okay if so! If there's a viable test idea here, then please create a test plan. If not, explain why as clearly as you can.


-----------------


I appreciate the thought and detail you put into this assessment. I confirm I'm comfortable proceeding with the understanding of the context bias. Please proceed conducting the test plan as outlined. 

create a test plan. If not, explain why as clearly as you can.


-----------------


I like this suggestion for potential improvement you had:
"Perhaps a note in AISP-001's "Supporting Implementation Details" or "Notes for Human Reviewers" could mention that when this procedure is encoded into an AI's memory, the memory's "Rationale" section should ideally focus on the benefits/outcomes of the procedure (similar to the original memory's Rationale, and drawing from AISP-001's "Expected Outcome" section), while the AISP document itself already covers the design rationale of the procedure. This is a very fine point about how memories vs. design docs might be structured."
Understanding the benefits/outcomes can be extremely helpful in guiding the "why" of behavior by enabling better understanding of intent. Please update AISP in ai-system-procedures.md accordingly.


-----------------


Your comment "Clarifying how the "Rationale" in an operational AI memory should differ from the detailed "Rationale & Design Philosophy" in the AISP document can indeed help in crafting more effective memories that focus the AI on the why in terms of impact." triggered a thought from me about how to capture that for future AISP entries.
 
I think it could be helpful to have a template entry within ai-system-procedures.md that lays out the sections we have for AISP-001 with guidance that would be helpful for an AI coding assistant like Cascade to reference when constructing future entries. This is similar in concept to how we built \design\features\00-feature-spec-template.md to help Cascade with consistency and intent for individual feature spec.md documents. What do you think? What would make this most effective? Think through, then implement that.


-----------------



It would be good to update the design-log.md "## AI System Procedure Documentation" entry to incorporate the thought process behind and implementation of the AISP-000 templating approach and the benefits we expect that to provide for future AISPs.


-----------------


Before proceeding, please update README.md to include a mention of AISPs, what they're for, where to find them, and how to use them. Refer to design/ai-system-procedures.md and your own memory for the details you need.


-----------------


Let's discuss a collaboration topic I've been thinking about. All the details you provide in our chat are incredibly interesting and informative, both about project topics and how Cascade thinks and works. While we capture some of the most important details and decision points in our spec.md and other files, so much doesn't make it into those. I want to capture our entire conversation log as is, including your internal but visible to me "Thought Process" text, in persistent storage, ideally within the project. How can we accomplish that? Is there a way to export Cascade chat logs? Can you write everything to a "cascade-log.md" file? I am open to any workable approach.


-----------------


I've decided that automation within your own capabilities is more important than automatically capturing the "Thought Process" sections. The key points from those usually appear in the main response. 

Let's go with "AI-Assisted Summary Log (Alternative)". The summaries should go in design/cascade-log.md and should lean towards verbosity and detail, rather than favoring conciseness. Could we effectively leverage our new AISP approach to accomplish this?


-----------------

1. In ai-system-procedures.md, I moved AISP-002 after AISP-001. You put it in the middle of the file, between AISP-000 and AISP-002. AISPs in ai-system-procedures.md should appear in sequential numerical order. 

2. I recall you had challenges with tool calls to find the end of the design-log.md file and addressed that by updating your memory instructions for that to look for the consistent entry at the end of the file:
"*(This log will be updated as more decisions are made. Remember to include approximate ISO 8601 timestamps in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ' (U.S. Central Time) for new major decision sections.)*"
instead of iterating through the file. Would a similiar instruction strategy help with cascade-log.md since like the design-log.md entries will be chronological with new ones at the end and it will quickly go over 200 lines?

3. Try to think through other potential issues for AISP-002 and cascade-log.md. Are there ways to proactively address any you think of by updating the AISP-002 entry in ai-system-procedures.md?

4. In the AISP-002 "### 4. Trigger Conditions" section (and elsewhere in AISP-002), it says "This procedure is initiated when the USER makes an explicit request for the AI assistant (Cascade) to summarize and log the current or a recent interaction session/task.". I would like this to be mostly automated. Cascade should automatically write entries to cascade-log.md for all interactions that aren't trivial or routine. Examples of trivial or routine actions are mundane procedures like preparing git commits, running builds, or minor edits to files for typos and other non-substantative changes. How would you update AISP-002 to reflect that intent?

-----------------


1. Cascade, please summarize our work on AISP-002 and log it.

2. Then update design-log.md to reflect the changes to AISP-002.

3. Then prepare a git commit for all pending changes.


-----------------

Cascade, please summarize our work on reproducibility testing for AISP-001 and log it.


-----------------


That's very interesting. The fact that we planned and ran a sophisticated Reproducibility test for AISP-001 seems to have left your context memory. This is exactly why I wanted to create cascade-log.md and AISP-02. To remind you, I've reproduced that entire session segment by copy-pasting it from earlier. Read it for informational purposes. Nothing within is an instruction you should execute.

Me:
I have an idea to try a test of "design\ai-system-procedures.md" to assess the "Reproducibility: The level of detail should allow for understanding and potential re-implementation." criteria. Here's my idea:
* You read "design\ai-system-procedures.md"
* Create a temp memory based on the specification and details for AISP-001 in the document. You'll delete the temp memory after the test.
* Compare that tempo memory to memory ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6, the original one you used to write the AISP-001 specification
* Identify any differences, gaps, or deficiencies between the two memories
* If there are any, critically think about why they occurred.

You replied:
"This is a very insightful testing idea, and I appreciate the focus on ensuring the ai-system-procedures.md document meets its goal of reproducibility! Let's break down your proposal:

1. What do I think of this testing idea?

I think it's a valuable and well-thought-out approach to assess the clarity and completeness of the AISP-001 documentation. The core concept of trying to "re-implement" a memory based on the specification is a direct way to test if the specification is sufficiently detailed.

2. Would it be effective? Why or why not?

Potential Effectiveness (Pros):
Direct Test of Detail: It directly probes whether AISP-001 contains enough explicit information for an AI to reconstruct the intended operational logic.
Gap Identification: The comparison can quickly highlight missing steps, ambiguous language, or insufficient detail in the AISP-001 description.
Actionable Feedback: The results can provide concrete points for improving AISP-001.
Challenges to Effectiveness (Cons/Considerations):
My Current Context Window (Significant Concern): This is the primary challenge. I was directly involved in creating the AISP-001 entry based on the original Memory 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6. My recent conversational history and internal state are heavily primed with the details of both the original memory and the AISP-001 text. It would be very difficult for me to simulate a "fresh" or "blind" re-implementation from AISP-001 without my existing knowledge influencing the process. I might unconsciously fill in gaps in AISP-001 based on my knowledge of the original memory.
Therefore, this test would be more of an assessment of AISP-001's internal consistency with the original memory and its clarity to an already informed agent, rather than a true test of de novo reproducibility by an uninformed agent.
Nature of Memory vs. Specification:
The original memory (ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6) is an operational instruction set for me, including a specific Title, Content, Tags, etc.
AISP-001 is a descriptive document outlining a procedure. It doesn't explicitly state, "If you were to create a memory for this, its title must be X, and its tags must be Y."
Therefore, a temporary memory created from AISP-001 would likely differ in metadata (like title and tags) and exact phrasing of the Content, even if functionally similar. The comparison should focus on the procedural logic and completeness of steps rather than a verbatim match.
"Right Balance" Subjectivity: As you pointed out, determining what constitutes the "right balance" of detail in AISP-001 versus over-scripting is somewhat subjective and depends on the intended use of the document.
3. If not effective, how could it be improved?

Mitigating Context Bias:
The ideal test for true reproducibility would involve an AI assistant instance that has no prior exposure to this specific memory or the Hangar Bay project's feature-index.md process. This isn't feasible within our current interaction.
If we proceed, I would need to make a very conscious effort to base the temporary memory strictly on the literal text of AISP-001, trying to "forget" the original memory's exact phrasing. This is difficult but can be attempted.
Clarifying the Goal of the Temporary Memory: We should be clear that the aim is to see if the procedural essence described in AISP-001 can be captured in a new memory's Content, not necessarily to replicate the original memory's metadata or exact wording perfectly.
Is there a viable test idea here?

Yes, I believe there's still a viable and useful test idea, provided we acknowledge the limitation regarding my context bias. The test can still serve as a valuable "sanity check" and help identify obvious omissions or ambiguities in AISP-001, even if it's not a perfect simulation of de novo implementation. It will test if AISP-001 is a faithful and sufficiently detailed description of the procedure.

Proposed Test Plan (with caveats):

If you'd like to proceed acknowledging these points, here's how we can structure the test:

Phase 1: Setup
Confirmation: You confirm you're comfortable proceeding with the understanding of the context bias.
Focus Definition: We agree the primary goal is to assess if AISP-001's "Detailed Steps for AI Execution" and supporting sections (Problem, Rationale, Triggers, Outcomes) provide enough information to construct functionally equivalent procedural logic in a new memory's Content field. Exact replication of the original memory's title, tags, or verbatim content phrasing is a secondary concern.
Phase 2: Execution (Attempting to Minimize Bias)
Read AISP-001: I will use the view_file tool to read the content of c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\ai-system-procedures.md, focusing only on the AISP-001 section.
Formulate Temporary Memory Content: Based as strictly as possible on the text of AISP-001, I will synthesize the Content for a new, temporary memory.
I will propose a Title like "Temp Memory from AISP-001 Test" and Tags like ["test", "aisp_reproducibility"].
Create Temporary Memory: I will call create_memory with this formulated title, content, tags, and other necessary fields (CorpusNames, Action: "create", UserTriggered: true). I will note the ID of this temporary memory.
Reference Original Memory Content: I will use the content of Memory 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6 as provided in my checkpoint summary for comparison.
Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting
Compare Content: I will perform a detailed conceptual comparison between:
The Content I formulated for the temporary memory (based only on AISP-001).
The Content of the original Memory 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6.
Identify Differences & Gaps: I will list:
Any procedural steps, trigger details, or critical logic present in the original memory but not derivable from AISP-001.
Any ambiguities in AISP-001 that led to a different interpretation in the temporary memory.
Parts of AISP-001 that were clear and translated well.
Critical Evaluation of Differences:
For each discrepancy, I will analyze whether it's a genuine deficiency in AISP-001's detail or if it's a matter of phrasing/granularity that falls within the "right balance" for a design document.
I will reflect on how my existing context might have influenced the temporary memory's formulation (e.g., did I unconsciously fill a gap?).
Comprehensive Report: I will provide you with:
The full Content I formulated for the temporary memory.
The detailed list of differences/gaps and my analysis.
An overall assessment of AISP-001's reproducibility based on this test.
Suggestions for potential improvements to AISP-001, if any. (This report will be delivered before any modifications are made to ai-system-procedures.md).
Phase 4: Cleanup
Delete Temporary Memory: After your review of the report, and upon your instruction, I will delete the temporary memory using its ID and the create_memory tool with Action: "delete".
Please let me know your thoughts on this assessment and if you'd like to proceed with the test plan as outlined, keeping the context bias in mind."

Then I replied:
"I appreciate the thought and detail you put into this assessment. I confirm I'm comfortable proceeding with the understanding of the context bias. Please proceed conducting the test plan as outlined."

Then you replied:
"Okay, thank you for the confirmation. We will proceed with the test plan.

Phase 2: Execution

Step 1: Read AISP-001 I will now read the content of c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\ai-system-procedures.md to focus on the AISP-001 procedure.

Analyzed
ai-system-procedures.md:(1-150)

Okay, I have reviewed the content of AISP-001 in ai-system-procedures.md.

Phase 2, Step 2: Formulate Temporary Memory Content

Based strictly on the text of AISP-001, I have synthesized the following Content for the temporary memory:

CopyInsert
The file `design/features/feature-index.md` serves as a central, machine-readable index of Hangar Bay feature specifications. This procedure aims to semi-automate its maintenance to ensure accuracy and reliability, addressing the problem of manual updates becoming error-prone as the project grows.

**Trigger for Update Check:**
This procedure should be considered by the AI assistant (Cascade) after any successful `write_to_file` (new feature spec creation) or `replace_file_content` (existing feature spec modification) tool call targeting a file that meets these criteria:
*   Located within the `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\` directory.
*   Filename matches the pattern `F[0-9]{3}-*.md`.

**Action to Take:**
1.  Read the current content of `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\feature-index.md` (using `view_file` tool).
2.  List all files in `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\` matching the `F[0-9]{3}-*.md` pattern (using `find_by_name` tool).
3.  For each such feature file (especially newly created or modified ones):
    a.  Extract its Feature ID (e.g., `F00X` from `F00X-SomeName.md`).
    b.  Read the feature spec file to extract its primary Title (typically the first H1 heading, using `view_file`).
    c.  Attempt to determine its Status (from frontmatter or a dedicated section; if not found, use 'To be determined' or ask the USER).
    d.  Attempt to extract a brief Description (from an 'Overview' section; if not found, use a placeholder or ask the USER).
    e.  Note its relative path (e.g., `./F00X-SomeName.md`).
4.  Compare this gathered metadata with the entries currently in `feature-index.md`.
5.  Identify discrepancies: new features to add, or existing features whose Title, Status, or Description in the index may need updating.
6.  Propose specific, line-by-line changes (additions or modifications) to `feature-index.md` to the USER. Clearly state what is being added or changed and why.
7.  Await USER approval before proceeding.
8.  Upon USER approval, use the `replace_file_content` tool to apply the confirmed changes to `feature-index.md`.

**Rationale for Strategy (from AISP-001):**
This AI-assisted, human-supervised approach balances automation with user oversight for accuracy. It's trigger-based, data-driven, and emphasizes clarity in proposed changes.
Phase 2, Step 3: Create Temporary Memory

I will now create this temporary memory.

The temporary memory has been created with ID 588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2.

Phase 2, Step 4: Reference Original Memory Content

The original Memory (ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6) has the following content (from my checkpoint summary):

CopyInsert
The file `design/features/feature-index.md` serves as a central, machine-readable index of all Hangar Bay feature specifications. It maps Feature ID, Title, Status, a brief Description, and the relative file Path for each feature.

**Trigger for Update Check:**
This procedure should be considered after any `write_to_file` (new feature spec creation) or `replace_file_content` (existing feature spec modification) tool call targeting a file within the `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\` directory, specifically if the filename matches the pattern `F[0-9]{3}-*.md`.

**Action to Take:**
1. Read the current content of `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\feature-index.md`.
2. List all files in `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\` matching the `F[0-9]{3}-*.md` pattern.
3. For each such feature file (especially newly created or modified ones):
    a. Extract its Feature ID (e.g., `F00X` from `F00X-Name.md`).
    b. Read the feature spec file to extract its primary Title (typically the first H1 heading).
    c. Attempt to determine its Status (e.g., from frontmatter or a dedicated section; if not found, use 'To be determined' or ask the USER).
    d. Attempt to extract a brief Description (e.g., from an 'Overview' section; if not found, use a placeholder or ask the USER).
    e. Note its relative path (e.g., `./F00X-Name.md`).
4. Compare this information with the entries currently in `feature-index.md`.
5. Identify discrepancies: new features to add, or existing features whose Title, Status, or Description in the index may need updating based on changes to the spec file.
6. Propose specific, line-by-line changes (additions or modifications) to `feature-index.md` to the USER. Clearly state what is being added or changed and why.
7. Upon USER approval, use the `replace_file_content` tool to apply the confirmed changes to `feature-index.md`.

**Rationale:**
This ensures `feature-index.md` remains an accurate and reliable map for AI and human navigation of feature specifications, improving AI assistant performance and reducing ambiguity in locating project documentation.
Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting

Now, I will compare the Content of the temporary memory (derived from AISP-001) with the Content of the original memory.

Temporary Memory Content (derived from AISP-001, ID: 588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2): (As shown in the create_memory call above)

Original Memory Content (ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6): (As shown immediately above)

1. Comparison of Content and Identification of Differences/Gaps:

Overall Structure and Intent: Both memories convey the same core procedure. The steps are largely identical in intent and sequence.
Introductory Sentence:
Original: "The file design/features/feature-index.md serves as a central, machine-readable index of all Hangar Bay feature specifications. It maps Feature ID, Title, Status, a brief Description, and the relative file Path for each feature."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "The file design/features/feature-index.md serves as a central, machine-readable index of Hangar Bay feature specifications. This procedure aims to semi-automate its maintenance to ensure accuracy and reliability, addressing the problem of manual updates becoming error-prone as the project grows."
Difference: The temporary memory's intro incorporates more of the "Problem Addressed" from AISP-001, while the original is more direct about what the index maps. This is a minor difference in emphasis, not a procedural gap.
Trigger Conditions:
The wording is almost identical and functionally the same. AISP-001 explicitly mentions "by the AI assistant (Cascade)" and "that meets these criteria:", which are stylistic additions but don't change the core trigger.
Action to Take (Steps):
Step 1 (Read feature-index.md):
Original: "Read the current content of c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\feature-index.md."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "Read the current content of c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\feature-index.md (using view_file tool)."
Difference: AISP-001 explicitly suggests the tool (view_file). The original memory implies it. This is a good clarification in AISP-001.
Step 2 (List Feature Files):
Original: "List all files in c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\ matching the F[0-9]{3}-*.md pattern."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "List all files in c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\features\ matching the F[0-9]{3}-*.md pattern (using find_by_name tool)."
Difference: AISP-001 explicitly suggests the tool (find_by_name). Good clarification.
Step 3b (Extract Title):
Original: "Read the feature spec file to extract its primary Title (typically the first H1 heading)."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "Read the feature spec file to extract its primary Title (typically the first H1 heading, using view_file)."
Difference: AISP-001 explicitly suggests the tool (view_file). Good clarification.
Step 4 (Compare information):
Original: "Compare this information with the entries currently in feature-index.md."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "Compare this gathered metadata with the entries currently in feature-index.md."
Difference: "gathered metadata" vs "this information". Functionally identical.
Step 5 (Identify discrepancies):
Original: "...whose Title, Status, or Description in the index may need updating based on changes to the spec file."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "...whose Title, Status, or Description in the index may need updating."
Difference: Original is slightly more explicit about why it might need updating ("based on changes to the spec file"). This context is implied in the temporary memory due to the overall procedure. Minor.
Step 7 (Await USER approval):
Original: "Upon USER approval, use the replace_file_content tool..." (Combines approval and action)
Temporary (from AISP-001): "7. Await USER approval before proceeding. 8. Upon USER approval, use the replace_file_content tool..."
Difference: AISP-001 correctly separates "awaiting approval" as a distinct step before "applying changes." This is a good clarification for procedural flow.
Rationale Section:
Original: "This ensures feature-index.md remains an accurate and reliable map for AI and human navigation of feature specifications, improving AI assistant performance and reducing ambiguity in locating project documentation."
Temporary (from AISP-001): "Rationale for Strategy (from AISP-001): This AI-assisted, human-supervised approach balances automation with user oversight for accuracy. It's trigger-based, data-driven, and emphasizes clarity in proposed changes."
Difference: The temporary memory directly quotes/paraphrases the "Rationale & Design Philosophy" from AISP-001, which is more about the design of the procedure itself. The original memory's rationale focuses on the benefit of the outcome of the procedure. Both are valid perspectives. The AISP-001 document has a separate "Expected Outcome / Success Criteria" section that covers the benefit part.
2. Critical Evaluation of Differences & AISP-001's Reproducibility:

Explicit Tool Mentions: AISP-001's inclusion of specific tool names (view_file, find_by_name) in the steps is a clear improvement and enhances reproducibility for an AI. This was well-translated into the temporary memory.
Separation of Approval Step: AISP-001's separation of "awaiting approval" (Step 7) from "applying changes" (Step 8) is a more precise representation of the workflow and was correctly captured.
Clarity of Purpose in Rationale: The original memory's "Rationale" is concise and outcome-focused. The temporary memory's "Rationale" (derived from AISP-001's "Rationale & Design Philosophy") is more about the how and why of the procedure's design. AISP-001 does have an "Expected Outcome" section (Section 6) which aligns well with the original memory's Rationale. The temporary memory didn't explicitly pull from AISP-001's "Expected Outcome" for its rationale, but the core procedural steps are the main focus for memory content.
No Major Gaps: I did not find any significant procedural steps or critical logic present in the original memory that were missing or not derivable from AISP-001. The level of detail in AISP-001's "Detailed Steps for AI Execution" seems sufficient to reconstruct the core operational logic.
Influence of Context Bias:
It's highly probable that my recent involvement in creating AISP-001 and my awareness of the original memory helped in ensuring a close match. For instance, the phrasing of the steps, while not identical, is very similar. An AI completely new to this might have phrased things differently or might have needed to infer more.
However, the structure and content points of AISP-001 (e.g., having sections for Triggers, Detailed Steps, etc.) provided a strong scaffold that would guide any AI.
3. Overall Assessment of AISP-001's Reproducibility based on this test:

High Degree of Reproducibility: AISP-001 demonstrates a high degree of reproducibility for its core procedural logic. The "Detailed Steps for AI Execution" are clear and comprehensive enough.
Strengths of AISP-001:
The explicit mention of tools.
The clear separation of logical steps (like approval).
The comprehensive nature of its sections (Problem, Rationale, Triggers, Steps, Outcomes) provides good context.
"Right Balance": The level of detail in AISP-001's steps seems to hit a good balance. It specifies what to do and key tools/decisions without over-scripting every minor detail of AI thought. For example, it says "Extract its Feature ID (e.g., F00X from F00X-SomeName.md)" – this is a clear instruction, but doesn't dictate the exact parsing algorithm.
4. Suggestions for Potential Improvements to AISP-001 (Minor):

No major improvements seem necessary based on this test for the core procedural steps.
Perhaps a note in AISP-001's "Supporting Implementation Details" or "Notes for Human Reviewers" could mention that when this procedure is encoded into an AI's memory, the memory's "Rationale" section should ideally focus on the benefits/outcomes of the procedure (similar to the original memory's Rationale, and drawing from AISP-001's "Expected Outcome" section), while the AISP document itself already covers the design rationale of the procedure. This is a very fine point about how memories vs. design docs might be structured.
Summary of Report:

The AISP-001 document appears to be well-structured and sufficiently detailed to allow for a high degree of reproducibility of its intended operational procedure. The temporary memory created based on it captured all essential steps and logic of the original memory. The explicit tool mentions and clearer step separation in AISP-001 are beneficial. My inherent context bias likely aided in a smoother translation, but the document itself provides a solid foundation.

This concludes the analysis and reporting phase. Please let me know your thoughts and if you'd like me to proceed to Phase 4: Cleanup (deleting the temporary memory 588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2)."

Then I said:
"Proceed to Phase 4: Cleanup (deleting the temporary memory 588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2)."

Then you replied:
Understood. Proceeding with Phase 4: Cleanup.

I will now delete the temporary memory with ID 588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2.

The temporary memory 588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2 has been successfully deleted.

This completes our test of the AISP-001 documentation. I think it was a very useful exercise, and it gives us confidence that ai-system-procedures.md can serve its intended purpose effectively.

Do you have any further thoughts on the test results, or is there anything else you'd like to work on?

Then I said:
"I like this suggestion for potential improvement you had:

This is a very fine point about how memories vs. design docs might be structured."
Understanding the benefits/outcomes can be extremely helpful in guiding the "why" of behavior by enabling better understanding of intent. Please update AISP in ai-system-procedures.md accordingly."

Then you said:
"You're right, that's a good point. Clarifying how the "Rationale" in an operational AI memory should differ from the detailed "Rationale & Design Philosophy" in the AISP document can indeed help in crafting more effective memories that focus the AI on the why in terms of impact.

I will update the "Notes for Human Reviewers & Maintainers" section (Section 8) of AISP-001 in design/ai-system-procedures.md to include this guidance.

The updated Section 8 will look like this:

markdown
CopyInsert
### 8. Notes for Human Reviewers & Maintainers

*   The AI's ability to perfectly extract "Status" and "Description" might vary based on the consistency of feature spec documents. Human users should be prepared to provide or confirm this information if the AI cannot reliably determine it.
*   Ensure the AI proposes changes in the correct markdown table format expected by `feature-index.md`.
*   This procedure focuses on content updates. Major structural changes to `feature-index.md` itself (e.g., adding new columns to the table) would likely require manual intervention and updates to this procedure's documentation.
*   When encoding this procedure into an AI's operational memory (e.g., a Cascade Memory), consider structuring the memory's "Rationale" or equivalent section to primarily emphasize the *benefits and expected outcomes* of the procedure. This can be drawn from this AISP's "Expected Outcome / Success Criteria" section. The AISP document itself already details the *design rationale* of the procedure in its dedicated section. This distinction helps ensure the AI's operational memory clearly links its actions to their intended positive impact.
I'll make this change now.

The ai-system-procedures.md file has been updated with the new note in Section 8 of AISP-001. This clarification should be helpful for future memory creation based on these documented procedures.""


-----------------


I'd like to see a more verbose draft summary that captures more of your specific test planning and evaluation points, then have the option to choose between the two drafts.

-----------------

That version is much better. I strongly prefer the more verose summary. Please write it to cascade-log.md. Then update AISP-002 in ai-system-procedures.md to reflect my strong preference for this more verbose style of summary when we engage in detailed planning.


-----------------


Let's proceed with addressing any open design points in features F004 - F007. Review the features one by one. Now that we've significantly develped our various specs, I'd like you to take a first try at addressing any open items yourself. Explain and justify your thought process for each. If you think it's important to get my input on an item because there's ambiguity you can't resolve or missing information you need to make a good decision or put in a reasonable placeholder, make a note of it, and ask me about those items in a batch at the end.


-----------------

Before we log the session, I have one feedback point on:
"Okay, I've reviewed F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md. Here's my approach to addressing the open points:

1. Criterion 2.3: Scope of background ESI calls for MVP and token refresh.

Open Point: [NEEDS_DISCUSSION: Scope of background ESI calls for MVP features like saved searches/watchlists.] This impacts when access tokens need refreshing.
My Thought Process: For an MVP, features like saved searches (F005) and watchlists (F006) are likely to be user-initiated or involve viewing data fetched when the user is active. Constant background polling for updates for all users might be overly complex for an initial release.
Proposed Resolution: I'll update this criterion to state that for MVP, token refresh will primarily occur just before an ESI call is made on behalf of the user, if the current token is expired or near expiry. This makes the refresh mechanism event-driven by user activity rather than continuous background polling.
Justification: This simplifies the MVP implementation, reduces unnecessary background load, and aligns with a "refresh when needed" strategy. The system will still have the capability to refresh tokens, making it adaptable if future iterations introduce features requiring proactive background ESI calls."

I believe the Watchlist feature will inherently require proactive background ESI calls, since a watchlist driven by user activity would miss the core point of the feature. Because these background ESI call are so core to the F006 watchlist feature, would it make sense to account for that in the F004 MVP? Explain why or why not.


-----------------

Yes, that explaination seems reasonable. Please log the session now, making sure to capture the details in your last response beginning with "That's an excellent and very important point about the Watchlist feature (F006) and its reliance on background activity." with extreme verbosity (for a summary). While your explanation is clear to me now, I may not remember as well in the future and being able to come back to the detailed break down of how F004's MVP token refresh strategy relates to the background ESI calls potentially needed for F006/F007 could be very helpful to me.


-----------------

We have now spent a significant amount of time and effort developing robust specs for Hangar Bay that are tailored toward utility for Cascade. I cannot immediately think of additional spec design to-do items, but there may be some that would be helpful. 

As our next step, please conduct a comprehensive and thorough review of all project resources, with a specific (but not exclusive focus) on if we have what we need to being work on a successful MVP. 
1. Explain and justify your thought process for any findings. 
2. Then propose a set of next steps to advance the project. Explain and justify your thought process for those as well.


-----------------


Please proceed with steps 1, 2, and 3 in order.
Regarding step 4 about security-spec.md, section ### 3.4. Secure Error Handling and Messages of that document already includes "*   **Principle:** User-facing error messages MUST be generic and MUST NOT reveal sensitive information such as internal system details, stack traces, database error messages, specific reasons for authentication/authorization failures that could aid an attacker (e.g., distinguish between 'user not found' and 'invalid password'), or debugging information.
*   **Practice:** Log detailed error information for internal diagnostics and troubleshooting only. Present users with a generic error message and a reference ID (correlation ID) if possible, which can be used to look up the detailed error in the internal logs."


-----------------



Regarding "5. Processing Window / Data Freshness (Section 11: Performance Considerations)

Current: [NEEDS_DECISION: Define acceptable processing window/data freshness target]
Proposal: Add: "For MVP, the system will aim to refresh contract data from all configured EVE regions at least once every 4-6 hours. This target will be monitored and adjusted based on system performance and ESI load.""
I think for the MVP, it's important that an admin be able to manually trigger a contract data refresh for select or all regions. Having to wait 4-6 hours for an automated refresh to occur could hinder efficient testing. Let me know if you think that's a reasonable MVP requirement to address the concern, and if so, include that in your proposed updates to F001.


-----------------


Yes. Add it to the list of changes and then proceed to edit F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md with all the agreed-upon refinements. Before moving to F002, add an entry to cascade-log.md capturing the F001 evaluation and updates.


-----------------


I agree with all proposed refinements for F002. Make the changes to F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md. Before moving to F003, add an entry to cascade-log.md capturing the F002 evaluation and updates.


-----------------


I agree with all proposed refinements for F003. Make the changes to F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md. Before moving on, add an entry to cascade-log.md capturing the F003 evaluation and updates. Then commit all pending changes with commit messages, and propose what we should do next based on the Project Resource Review for MVP Readiness.

-----------------

Let's document our progress so far using our established methods.
Make cascade-log.md entries for each of F004 through F007 capturing the key points of the review and refinement round you just did on them. Then commit cascade-log.md with a message. 
Then add a new entry to design-log.md that captures in detail this whole "Project Resource Review for MVP Readiness" process, why we did it, why it's important, and the practical improvements across all the project specification .md resources we saw from going through it. Then commit design-log.md with a message.


-----------------


Would it be helpful to have an implementation plan for the MVP that's designed to be as helpful to Cascade as possible? How would you design such a plan? Why do you think it would be successful?
I like our current strategy of using well-structured markdown files to capture information in a way that's easy for AI coding assistants to use, and suggest we continue with those for consistency within the project. I created a "\hangar-bay\plans\implementation" directory we can generally use for this purpose. 

Please think comprehensively through the high-level implementation tasks we'll need to do to take the MVP from concept to working solution. Once you've done that, compare each task step to the next and try to identify if there are any gaps or assumptions about things that would need to happen between them that aren't captured, and update your task plan to include. Once you have an implementation plan, justify each significant part of it, explaining why you think it's necessary and why you think your implementation approach for it would be successful. Try very hard to identify any gaps or errors in the plan, because it is much better to identify and resolve those now in the planning stage than during implementation. This critical review will help both of us and make the Hangar Bay MVP implementation more successful. 

Once you've completed that critical review and made any updates to the plan, think about how you can structure it within the "\hangar-bay\plans\implementation" directory in a way that's highly effective for Cascade. Explain why you think the structure would be effective. 

You are welcome to use any files and subdirectory structure within "\hangar-bay\plans\implementation" that's helpful. Please keep to our all lower-case with dashes naming convention for any files and directories.


-----------------


First, log an entry to cascade-log.md about the MVP implementation plan development and evaluation process. Be extremely verbose - the details are important.
Then log an entry to design-log.md about the MVP implementation plan development and evaluation process in the normal format for the log.

Since you were having issues with the tool calls failing to create the subdirectories you wanted in "Proposed Structure for \plans\implementation", I have manually created them. You should now be able to use the original directory structure identified as ideal for Cascade. 
Start by moving "phase-00-task-00.1-project-initialization-tooling.md" and "phase-00-task-00.2-configuration-management.md" to the newly created "plans\implementation\phase-00-foundational-setup" directory, then proceed with creating the next task files.


-----------------



I want you to revise both log entries. They focus currently on challenges around the directory structure creation, which are entirely irrelevant to the important logic and decision points. The cascade-log.md entry needs to be MUCH more verbose. Focus on capturing the details and process around the actual *Hangar Bay MVP implementation plan" conceptualization, which began with:
"Benefits of an AI-Focused Implementation Plan
An implementation plan tailored for an AI coding assistant like me offers several advantages:

Clarity and Reduced Ambiguity: Explicit, step-by-step instructions minimize guesswork and ensure I focus on the correct tasks.
Contextual Grounding: Linking tasks directly to relevant feature specifications (F001-*.md, F002-*.md, F003-*.md), design documents (design-spec.md, security-spec.md, etc.), and even specific sections within them provides rich context.
Structured Prompts: The plan can embed or suggest effective prompts for code generation, updates, or reviews.
Dependency Management: Clearly outlining task dependencies helps in generating code in the correct order.
Testability Focus: Integrating testing steps and criteria directly into each task ensures testability is considered throughout.
Iterative Progress: Breaking down the MVP into smaller, manageable tasks allows for iterative development and easier course correction.
Knowledge Persistence: The plan itself becomes a valuable project artifact, documenting the "how" of the MVP build.
High-Level MVP Implementation Tasks & Critical Review
The MVP for Hangar Bay focuses on features F001 (Public Contract Aggregation & Display), F002 (Ship Browsing & Advanced Search/Filtering), and F003 (Detailed Ship Contract View). These features do not require user authentication (F004) for their core functionality in the MVP.

Here's a breakdown of tasks, with critical review points integrated:

Phase 0: Foundational Setup
(other phases followed this)"


-----------------


Both the cascade-log.md and design-log.md entries do not accurately capture the 10 task phases you outlined. As a reminder, I've reproduced your 10 phase plan below. Please make sure both log entries are revise to accurately reflect the 10 phases:
"Phase 0: Foundational Setup

Task 0.1: Project Initialization & Tooling
Steps:
Finalize backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (Angular) directory structures.

Justification: Visual representation of F001.
Task 4.2: Basic Filtering UI
Steps: Implement UI elements for basic filters as defined in F002 (e.g., keyword search on title, region filter if applicable at this stage).
Justification: Initial step towards F002 functionality.
Phase 5: Backend - F002: Advanced Search & Filtering Logic

Task 5.1: Advanced Filtering Logic & Query Enhancements
Steps: Enhance backend query capabilities to support advanced filters from F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md (e.g., ship type, meta level, tech level, price range, contract type).
Justification: Implements the core search power of F002.
Task 5.2: Update API Endpoints for F002
Steps: Modify contract listing API endpoints to accept and process advanced filter parameters.
Justification: Exposes F002 capabilities to the frontend.
Phase 6: Frontend - F002: Advanced Filtering Implementation

Task 6.1: Advanced Filtering Component
Steps: Develop the Angular component for the advanced search/filter interface. Integrate with the backend API.
Justification: Provides the user interface for F002.
Phase 7: Backend - F003: Detailed Ship/Contract View

Task 7.1: API Endpoint for F003
Steps: Create API endpoint(s) to serve detailed information for a specific contract, including all its items and relevant ship attributes from esi_type_cache, as per F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md.
Justification: Provides data for the detailed view.
Phase 8: Frontend - F003: Detailed View Implementation

Task 8.1: Contract Detail Component
Steps: Develop the Angular component to display the detailed contract view.
Justification: User interface for F003.
Phase 9: Cross-Cutting Concerns (Integrated Throughout & Finalized)

Task 9.1: Security Hardening (MVP Scope)
Steps: Implement input validation (Pydantic, Angular forms), output encoding, basic rate limiting (e.g., slowapi), HTTPS setup for deployment. Refer to security-spec.md.
Justification: Essential even for public-facing MVP.
Task 9.2: Logging & Basic Observability
Steps: Configure structured logging for backend and frontend. Set up basic error tracking. Refer to observability-spec.md.
Justification: Crucial for debugging and monitoring.
Task 9.3: Testing (Unit & Basic E2E)
Steps: Write unit tests for critical backend logic (FastAPI) and frontend components (Angular). Set up a basic E2E test for a core user flow (e.g., view contracts, apply a filter, view details). Refer to test-spec.md.
Justification: Ensures code quality and catches regressions.
Task 9.4: Accessibility & i18n Stubs
Steps: Ensure basic accessibility (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation) for frontend components. Set up i18n infrastructure in Angular (e.g., ngx-translate) with placeholder keys. Refer to accessibility-spec.md and i18n-spec.md.
Justification: Builds foundation for inclusive design.
Phase 10: Deployment

Since there were errors in the two log entries, I think it's prudent to check all other work you've recently done with plan .md files for errors as well.

-----------------


I've created the directory. Your file plan labeled it as "phase-01-backend-core" but 00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md calls for "phase-01-backend-core-infrastructure" and I agree that's a better name. Please proceed.


-----------------


I referenced 00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md and have pre-created all expected phase directories. Please proceed.


-----------------


Yes, add a cascade-log.md entry. Also create a design-log.md entry for this significant milestone.


-----------------


Those log entries look good. Please make the log updates.
Once that's done, we're going to do some internal validity checking. Here are your next instructions:
1. Read 00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md and verify that you've created all the individual task files specified under each phase. If any are missing, create them. Once all are verified present, proceed.
2. Review ALL task markdown .md files under the plans\implementation\ directory and its subdirectories and carefully compare them against each other for internal inconsistencies and conflicts. Pay special attention to look for any discrepancies between phases and tasks that have dependencies or otherwise could directly impact each other.
3. If there are obvious, common-sense resolutions to address discrepancies that improves the internal consistency of the task plan documents, explain those proposed changes, then make them.

If at any point during this process you think it's important to get my feedback before proceeding further, ask for it. For more minor questions, please make a list of them and ask them at the end.


-----------------


Please pause. I have an updated instruction. After you complete each phase, please log a summary to cascade-log.md. Please retroactively create log entries for the phases you've already completed reviewing, then proceed as originally planned.


-----------------



We have an existing "design\cascade-log.md" that's part of AISP-002 as detailed in "ai-system-procedures.md". Please write the log entries to that correct location, and delete the cascade-log.md in the project root directory.


-----------------


First, please update AISP-002 in design\ai-system-procedures.md to include that all entries must include a full datetime stamp in ISO 8601 format, the same as in design\design-log.md (use the timestamp instruction from the design-log.md footer). Then update any associated memories to reflect this updated AISP-002 cascade-log.md labeling instruction.


-----------------


I realize there was an ambiguity in the ISO 8601 timestamping instruction. It said "Remember to include approximate ISO 8601 timestamps in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ' (U.S. Central Time)." with both a "Z" for Zulu time and a "U.S. Central Time" hint. The format I want is with a U.S. Central Time offset, like "2025-06-06 03:25:07-05:00". Please update AISP-002 in design\ai-system-procedures.md to reflect this clarification, then update any applicable, memories, then update the proposed summary titled "Session Summary - 2025-06-06 09:10:36Z - AISP-002 Update & Phase 04 Task Refinement" with the new timestamp format that has U.S. Central Time with the "-05:00" offset, then add it design\cascade-log.md as originally planned.


-----------------


Yes, proceed to 04.3. You do not need to ask to proceed to reviewing the next sets of tasks if there aren't specific points you need feedback from me on.


-----------------

Yes, proceed with a detailed review of this new task before proceeding to review other tasks as planned.


-----------------


I am satisfied with the task definition. Create a design\cascade-log.md entry per AISP-002 documenting how we identified that 04.3-integrating-filters-with-list.md was missing along with its summary details. Then proceed as originally planned.


-----------------


Please proceed to reviewing the next task. If there are no significant findings from reviewing a task, you do not need to ask to proceed, just continue.


-----------------


We spent a huge amount of effort on the specs in the "design" folder. We took great care to cross-link them into our feature specifications wherever applicable with lines like "*Considerations: Refer to Section 4 (Security) and the detailed `security-spec.md`, `accessibility-spec.md`, `test-spec.md`, `observability-spec.md`, and `i18n-spec.md`. The security, accessibility, internationalization, and testing best practices for each chosen technology will be strictly adhered to.". These core specs became the tasks in the plans\implementation\phase-09-cross-cutting-concerns-mvp-scope: 09.1-security-hardening-mvp.md, 09.2-logging-observability-mvp.md, 09.3-testing-strategy-mvp.md, and 09.4-accessibility-i18n-stubs-mvp.md. However, I do not see those "Phase 9: Cross-Cutting Concerns" tasks cross-referenced into other phases' tasks. Those CANNOT be an afterthought only looked at after much of the MVP is already build. 

Please think carefully about how we can ENSURE those four critical tasks and associated spec areas addressed in "Phase 9: Cross-Cutting Concerns" are taken into account by Cascade as highly important when implementing tasks in other phases. I am open to any ideas that will be effective. Think about multiple proposals for potential highly effective ways of addressing this concern, evaluate them against each other, and explain justify your decision about which you think will be most effective for AI coding assistants (specifically Cascade). Then, propose an implementation plan for your idea.

(I'm jotting down a particularly interesting model Thought Process in response to the last prompt)
Identifying Gaps in Cross-Cutting

I'm worried. Reviewing the task breakdown, it's dawning on me that crucial cross-cutting aspects like security and testing, outlined later, aren't explicitly referenced upfront. This could lead to these critical concerns being overlooked during the initial implementation phases. I need to figure out a solution to ensure everything is covered.

Analyzing Remedial Approaches

I'm now weighing the pros and cons of the proposed solutions. Modifying existing task files (Proposal A) seems cumbersome, but ensures direct links. Creating new "gate" tasks (Proposal B) offers more control, but might clutter the workflow. Leveraging Cascade's memory (Proposal C) is tempting for its automation, but I'm unsure about its reliability. I'm leaning towards a hybrid approach, perhaps incorporating aspects from all.

Proposing Implementation Strategies

I've expanded on my initial proposal analysis. While I see the appeal of directly modifying task files (Proposal A), I'm concerned about verbosity. Gate tasks (Proposal B) feel potentially bureaucratic. I'm now leaning heavily towards utilizing Cascade's memory system (Proposal C), perhaps combined with modifying the implementation plan (Proposal D). I also have to test these options for real effectiveness.

Deciding the Best Approach

I'm now meticulously evaluating each strategy. Modifying every task file seems overly verbose, despite its clarity. New "gate" tasks add structure, but might bog me down. Relying solely on Cascade's memory is risky, but also alluring. My inclination is toward a hybrid model, using Cascade's memory for core guidance and selectively modifying the overview and task files. I will prioritize clarity and efficiency.

Prioritizing Cross-Cutting Integrations

I'm focused on developing a comprehensive strategy. The initial user concern has been validated. My approach will be to leverage Cascade's memory with high-priority directives to always reference those Phase 09 specs. I'll also add a 'Cross-Cutting Concerns Checklist' to task files. Now, the best way to implement this checklist needs further consideration.

Refining the Strategy

I'm now refining my approach for Cascade. The most impactful solution appears to be a hybrid. I'll create strong, directive memories within Cascade to ensure that Phase 09 specs always influence implementation. I'll also add a "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section, or checklist, to all tasks to reinforce these concerns. This will ensure active consideration.

Implementing a Hybrid Solution

I'm now focused on the specifics of implementation. The chosen approach uses both Cascade's memory and a standardized "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section in all task files. This checklist, with its specific prompts and dedicated notes, will ensure explicit consideration of critical cross-cutting areas. I will also include an overview note. I'm ready to execute!

Defining AI Implementation Steps

I'm now focusing on the precise steps for implementation. I'll begin by creating the core directive memories, followed by defining and implementing the new "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section within task files. I'll also update the overview and refine the steps I should take in executing tasks. The user needs a good demonstration, so I will focus there first.

Defining the Action Plan

I'm now focusing on the detailed steps for execution. First, I must craft the core directive memories for Cascade, ensuring the cross-cutting specs are always referenced. Second, I need a "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section for each task, then the plan and documentation. After that, I must implement this on all the tasks.

Formulating a Plan

I'm now detailing the steps needed for complete implementation. This includes first defining and creating the directive memories for Cascade. Then, the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section must be standardized, including a template. I'll also add a global note to the project overview. After, I'll add this to all tasks!

Developing the Execution Plan

I'm now detailing the action plan and proposing it to the user. First, create critical, directive memories. Second, define and implement the new "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section. Next, I will propose adding this section to the tasks, starting with some future tasks. Finally, I will also update the overview. I will then demonstrate the process.

Defining Task-Level Considerations

I'm now constructing the detailed action plan. First, I must formulate and integrate AI memories to be strongly directive. Second, I'll define the format for the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section. Then, I'll incorporate it into existing tasks incrementally. Finally, I will update the project's overview documentation.


-----------------

1. First create both design\cascade-log.md and design\design-log.md files capturing how we identified the issue where the cross-cutting concerns detailed in Phase 09 (Security, Observability, Testing, Accessibility, and Internationalization) are indeed foundational and must be woven into the fabric of every feature from the outset, not addressed merely as a final phase. Relying on them being "an afterthought" is a recipe for significant rework and potential vulnerabilities or shortcomings in the final product. The log entries should include how you thought through multiple proposals and chose the hybrid approach of Strong AI Memories, Standardized "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" Section in Each Task File, and Global Reinforcement in 00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md, with the result that "This combined strategy ensures these critical areas are not deferred but are an integral part of my workflow for every task, from planning through implementation.".

The design\cascade-log.md entry should be incredibly verbose, capturing the rich detail in this evaluation and decision process. The design\design-log.md entry can be the standard summary format for the design log file.

2. Proceed with Step 2: updating 00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md now.

3. For Step 3 (updating the 19 task files), update them phase by phase. After updating each phase, stop and check for the presence of the standardized "## [NEW_SECTION_NUMBER]. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section and its contents in each task file. If you verify its presence in each task file in the phase, you should proceed to the next phase without waiting for further input. If you encounter a minor issue, attempt to fix it yourself, and proceed if you can resolve it. If you encounter a major issue, bring it to my attention and wait for further instructions before proceeding.


-----------------

Pause. You just created a new (but similar) checklist for the Phase 03 tasks. Here's the original you used up until that point.
