### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 04:46 - Topic: Enhancement of AISP-002 (AI-Assisted Session Summary Logging)

This session focused on significantly enhancing the AI-Assisted Session Summary Logging system, primarily documented in AISP-002. The key developments and decisions include:

1.  **Establishment of `design/cascade-log.md`:**
    *   A dedicated file, `design/cascade-log.md`, was created to store persistent, AI-generated summaries of interaction sessions.
    *   A consistent footer (`--- \n\n*(End of Cascade Interaction Log. New entries are appended above this line.)*`) was added to this file to ensure reliable and robust appending of new log entries.

2.  **Refinement of AISP-002 to Version 1.1:**
    *   The AI System Procedure `[AISP-002] AI-Assisted Session Summary Logging` (located in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`) was updated from its initial draft to version 1.1.
    *   **Proactive Logging Trigger:** The AI (Cascade) will now proactively identify suitable junctures (completion of non-trivial work like new file creation, significant edits, complex bug fixes, key design decisions) to propose logging a session summary to the USER, rather than solely relying on explicit USER commands.
    *   **Exclusion Criteria:** Trivial or routine actions (e.g., minor edits, simple Git operations, basic file views) are explicitly excluded from triggering logging proposals to avoid excessive noise.
    *   **Robust Append Strategy:** The procedure now specifies using the consistent footer in `design/cascade-log.md` as the target for appending new summaries, improving reliability.
    *   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for append failures was included, with instructions to notify the USER and provide fallback options.
    *   **Emphasis on Detail:** The procedure continues to emphasize the creation of verbose, rationale-focused summaries to maximize the contextual value of the logs.
    *   **AISP Reordering:** AISP-002 was correctly reordered within `design/ai-system-procedures.md` to maintain numerical sequence after AISP-001.

3.  **Update to Cascade's Operational Memory:**
    *   Cascade's internal operational memory (ID: `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`), which guides its execution of AISP-002, was updated to align precisely with the revised v1.1 procedure. This ensures the AI's behavior matches the documented standard.

4.  **Supporting Documentation Updates:**
    *   `design-log.md` was updated to reflect the initial creation of `cascade-log.md` and AISP-002.
    *   `starting-prompt.txt` was updated with USER feedback related to the logging system.

**Overall Goal:** These changes aim to create a more automated, reliable, and contextually rich system for logging significant AI-User interactions, making the `cascade-log.md` a valuable historical and contextual resource for the Hangar Bay project. The system balances AI proactivity with USER control.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 04:59 - Topic: In-depth Reproducibility Test of AISP-001 (Automated `feature-index.md` Maintenance)

This session segment featured a comprehensive test of the `[AISP-001] Automated Maintenance of feature-index.md` procedure, as documented in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`. The primary goal was to rigorously assess its reproducibility by simulating the creation of an operational AI memory based solely on the AISP-001 specification.

**Test Conception and Planning:**
*   **USER Rationale:** The USER proposed the test to evaluate if AISP-001's level of detail was sufficient for understanding and potential re-implementation, a key criterion for such documentation.
*   **Proposed Methodology:**
    1.  Cascade reads AISP-001.
    2.  Cascade creates a temporary operational memory based *only* on AISP-001.
    3.  Cascade compares this temporary memory to the original memory (ID: `8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6`) which informed AISP-001's creation.
    4.  Cascade identifies differences, analyzes their significance (considering the "right balance" of detail vs. over-scripting), and reports findings before any document changes.
*   **Cascade's Initial Assessment of the Test Idea:**
    *   **Effectiveness (Pros):** Deemed a valuable approach to directly probe if AISP-001 contained enough explicit information for an AI to reconstruct the intended logic and to identify potential gaps or ambiguities.
    *   **Challenges (Cons/Considerations):**
        *   **Context Window Bias (Significant Concern):** Cascade acknowledged a strong potential for bias, as it was directly involved in creating AISP-001 from the original memory. It was noted that a true de novo reproducibility test would require an AI instance with no prior project exposure. The test was thus framed as an assessment of AISP-001's internal consistency and clarity to an *already informed* agent.
        *   **Nature of Memory vs. Specification:** Differences in metadata (title, tags) and exact phrasing were expected, with the focus being on procedural logic equivalence.
*   **Agreed Test Plan:** A multi-phase plan was adopted: Setup (confirming understanding of bias, defining focus on procedural logic), Execution (reading AISP-001, formulating and creating temporary memory, referencing original memory), Analysis & Reporting (detailed comparison, critical evaluation, comprehensive report), and Cleanup (deleting temporary memory).

**Test Execution Details:**
1.  **Reading AISP-001:** Cascade reviewed the AISP-001 section in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`.
2.  **Temporary Memory Formulation:** Content for a new memory was synthesized strictly from AISP-001's text. Title: "Temp Memory from AISP-001 Test", Tags: ["test", "aisp_reproducibility"].
3.  **Temporary Memory Creation:** The temporary memory was created (ID: `588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2`).
4.  **Original Memory Reference:** The content of the original memory (`8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6`) was used for comparison.

**Detailed Analysis & Reporting - Key Comparison Points:**
*   **Overall Structure & Intent:** Both memories conveyed the same core procedure with largely identical steps.
*   **Introductory Sentences:** The temporary memory's intro (from AISP-001) included more of the "Problem Addressed," while the original was more direct about the index's mapping function. Deemed a minor difference in emphasis.
*   **Trigger Conditions:** Functionally identical; AISP-001 added minor stylistic clarifications.
*   **Action Steps - Enhancements in AISP-001:**
    *   **Explicit Tool Mentions:** AISP-001's inclusion of specific tool names (e.g., `view_file` for reading `feature-index.md` and feature specs, `find_by_name` for listing feature files) was a clear improvement over the original memory's implied tool usage. This was well-translated.
    *   **Separation of Approval Step:** AISP-001 correctly separated "7. Await USER approval before proceeding" from "8. Upon USER approval, use the `replace_file_content` tool," which was a more precise procedural representation than the original memory's combined step.
*   **Rationale Section Differences:**
    *   The temporary memory's rationale (from AISP-001's "Rationale & Design Philosophy") focused on the *design of the procedure* (AI-assisted, human-supervised, trigger-based).
    *   The original memory's rationale focused on the *benefits/outcomes* of the procedure (accurate map, improved AI performance, reduced ambiguity).
    *   This difference was considered acceptable as AISP-001 also contained a separate "Expected Outcome / Success Criteria" section that aligned with the original memory's rationale.
*   **No Major Gaps Identified:** No significant procedural steps or critical logic from the original memory were found to be missing or underivable from AISP-001.
*   **Evaluation of "Right Balance":** The level of detail in AISP-001's steps was assessed as achieving a good balance, specifying *what* to do and key tools/decisions without over-scripting AI thought processes (e.g., "Extract its Feature ID (e.g., F00X from F00X-SomeName.md)" is clear but not overly prescriptive on parsing).
*   **Influence of Context Bias:** Cascade acknowledged its existing context likely facilitated a close match, but the strong scaffolding provided by AISP-001's structure was deemed beneficial for any AI.

**Overall Assessment of AISP-001's Reproducibility:**
*   AISP-001 demonstrated a **high degree of reproducibility** for its core procedural logic.
*   The document was found to be well-structured and sufficiently detailed.

**Outcome & Action Taken:**
*   **Suggestion for AISP-001 Improvement:** Stemming from the "Rationale" section analysis, Cascade proposed a minor improvement: AISP-001's "Notes for Human Reviewers & Maintainers" section could suggest that when encoding the procedure into an AI's operational memory, the memory's "Rationale" should primarily emphasize the *benefits and expected outcomes* (drawing from AISP-001's "Expected Outcome / Success Criteria" section). This would ensure the AI's operational memory clearly links actions to their intended positive impact, while the AISP document itself details the procedure's design rationale.
*   **AISP-001 Update:** The USER concurred. Cascade updated Section 8 of AISP-001 in `design/ai-system-procedures.md` with this guidance: *"...When encoding this procedure into an AI's operational memory...consider structuring the memory's "Rationale"...to primarily emphasize the benefits and expected outcomes...This distinction helps ensure the AI's operational memory clearly links its actions to their intended positive impact."*
*   **Cleanup:** The temporary memory (`588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2`) was successfully deleted.

**Conclusion:** The in-depth test was a successful and valuable exercise. It validated the quality and reproducibility of the AISP-001 documentation and resulted in a practical refinement to guide future AI memory creation based on AISP specifications.

### Session Log: 2025-06-06

**AI Assistant:** Cascade
**User:** Sam
**Objective:** Systematically review and resolve open design points and ambiguities in feature specifications F004 through F007, update documentation, and incorporate user feedback for clarity.

**Summary of Activities & Resolutions:**

During this session, we completed the review and update of feature specifications F004, F005, F006, and F007, addressing all identified open design points and ambiguities. The "Last Updated" date for all modified documents was set to 2025-06-06.

1.  **F004 - User Authentication with EVE SSO (`design/features/F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md`)**
    *   **Token Refresh Scope (MVP):**
        *   Clarified that for MVP, token refresh will primarily be event-driven, occurring just before an ESI call is made on behalf of the user if the current access token is expired or near expiry. This approach avoids the complexity of a continuous background speculative refresh service for all users.
        *   **Detailed Discussion on F004 Token Refresh in Relation to F006/F007 Background ESI Calls:**
            *   The user raised a critical point about the Watchlist feature (F006) inherently requiring proactive background activity to be useful, questioning if F004's MVP token refresh strategy adequately supports this.
            *   **Resolution & Clarification:**
                1.  **F004's Core Philosophy:** The F004 MVP aims for an "on-demand" or "event-driven" token refresh. An "event" can be a direct user UI action or a scheduled background task (like for F007 alerts) that needs to make an ESI call using a specific user's token. F004 provides the *capability* (the logic and function) to refresh a token.
                2.  **Avoidance of Continuous Global Refresh:** F004 MVP deliberately avoids a separate, continuous background service that speculatively refreshes *all* user tokens *all the time*, irrespective of immediate need, to reduce initial complexity.
                3.  **F006/F007 MVP ESI Token Interaction:** For the current MVP scope, F007 (Alerts) uses F006 (Watchlists) and F001 (Public Contract Data). The background task for F007 compares user watchlist criteria against *locally stored public contract data from F001*. The process populating F001 typically uses an application-level ESI token or unauthenticated calls for public data, *not individual user access tokens*. Thus, the F006/F007 MVP background alerting task itself might not directly make ESI calls requiring individual user tokens.
                4.  **F004's Support for Background User-Specific ESI Calls:** F004's design *does account for and support* the scenario where background tasks might need to refresh user-specific tokens. If a background task (for F006/F007 or future features) *does* need to make an ESI call requiring a specific user's token (e.g., if watchlists were expanded to monitor private assets), that task would use the F004-provided mechanism: check token validity, refresh if needed.
                5.  **Conclusion:** F004 provides the *tool* for token refresh. Any system component (foreground UI-triggered or background task-triggered) needing to make a user-specific ESI call can and should use this tool. The F004 approach is adaptable for future features or expansions of F006/F007 that require background, user-specific ESI calls. The key is that the refresh is triggered by a need, not by continuous speculation.
    *   **Logout Behavior:** Confirmed that Hangar Bay logout invalidates the local application session only and does not revoke the EVE SSO refresh token at the identity provider, aligning with standard OAuth 2.0 practices.
    *   **ESI Scopes Requested:** A minimal base set of scopes (e.g., `publicData`) will be requested during initial authentication primarily for user identification. The application will store and operate based on the scopes actually granted by the user.
    *   **AI Checklist Items:** Updated relevant AI checklist items for EVE SSO OAuth endpoints to "Developer Action" with notes emphasizing these are developer verification steps against official documentation.

2.  **F005 - Saved Searches (`design/features/F005-Saved-Searches.md`)**
    *   **MVP Scope for Updates:** Resolved that for MVP, users can only rename and delete existing saved searches. Updating the underlying search criteria of a saved search is deferred to post-MVP.
    *   **Duplicate Saved Search Names:** Confirmed that duplicate saved search names per user will be prevented via a unique database constraint on `(user_id, name)`. The API will return a 409 Conflict status with a user-friendly error message.
    *   **AI Note on UI Mockups:** Added an AI note clarifying that UI mockups for saved search interactions are a design phase responsibility.

3.  **F006 - Watchlists (`design/features/F006-Watchlists.md`)**
    *   **Live Market Data Display:** Clarified that displaying live market data (e.g., current lowest price) directly in the watchlist view is out of scope for F006 itself. This functionality is primarily handled by F007 (Alerts/Notifications) which processes watchlist criteria against market data.
    *   **`notes` Field:** Confirmed the inclusion of an optional `notes` text field in the `watchlist_items` table for user annotations.
    *   **Duplicate Watchlist Items:** Confirmed a uniqueness constraint on `(user_id, type_id)` in the `watchlist_items` table to prevent duplicate entries for the same item type per user. API will respond with 409 Conflict.
    *   **AI Checklist Items:** Changed AI checklist items related to ESI universe type endpoints to "Developer Action" with explanatory notes for developer verification.
    *   **AI Note on UI Mockups:** Added an AI note that UI mockups for watchlist pages and interactions are a design phase responsibility.

4.  **F007 - Alerts and Notifications (`design/features/F007-Alerts-Notifications.md`)**
    *   **Email Notifications:** Deferred to post-MVP to reduce initial complexity. MVP will focus on in-app notifications.
    *   **Saved Search Alerts:** Deferred to post-MVP. MVP alerts will be based on watchlist criteria.
    *   **Notification De-duplication (MVP):** A notification is generated once for a unique `(user_id, contract_id, watchlist_item_id)` match. Re-notification for the same contract may occur if it's re-listed after a significant period or if its price drops further significantly below the user's `max_price`, subject to a cooldown (e.g., 24 hours).
    *   **Auction Notifications (MVP):** Notifications trigger if the current auction bid meets or is below the user's `max_price`. Further significant price drops can trigger new notifications per de-duplication rules.
    *   **Notification Content (MVP):** Messages will include item name, price found, location (if available), and a direct link to the contract.
    *   **Data Models:**
        *   `notifications` table: `type` field enum simplified to `'watchlist_match'`, `'system_message'`. 
        *   `user_notification_settings` table: Simplified to include `user_id`, `enable_watchlist_alerts` (default true), and `updated_at`. Fields for saved search alerts and email notifications removed for MVP.
    *   **API Endpoints:** `GET /api/v1/me/notification-settings` and `PUT /api/v1/me/notification-settings` updated to reflect the simplified `UserNotificationSettingDisplay` and `UserNotificationSettingUpdate` Pydantic models (only `enable_watchlist_alerts`).
    *   **Workflow:** Backend check frequency for watchlist alerts set to "e.g., every 15-30 minutes for MVP, configurable."
    *   **UI/UX:** Added standard AI note regarding design team responsibility for mockups.
    *   **Section 15 ("Notes / Open Questions"):** Retitled to "Design Clarifications and Resolutions." Content updated to reflect that previously open points (MVP notification channels, check frequency) are now resolved and other points are clarifications of MVP scope.

**User Feedback Incorporated:**
*   The detailed explanation regarding F004 token refresh strategy and its support for potential background ESI calls required by features like F006/F007 was explicitly requested for inclusion in this summary for future reference.

**Files Modified:**
*   `design/features/F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md`
*   `design/features/F005-Saved-Searches.md`
*   `design/features/F006-Watchlists.md`
*   `design/features/F007-Alerts-Notifications.md`

**Next Steps (per user request):**
*   Stage and prepare commits for all pending changes.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 05:40 - Topic: Refinement of AISP-002 Logging Procedure to Prevent Separator Issues

**Objective:** To diagnose and resolve a recurring formatting issue in `design/cascade-log.md` related to duplicate Markdown separators (`---`) and to update the guiding AI System Procedure (AISP-002) to prevent future occurrences.

**Background:**
Following the previous session where feature specifications F004-F007 were updated and a summary was logged to `design/cascade-log.md`, a formatting error was observed: an extra `---` separator appeared between the newly appended log entry and the standard log footer.

**Diagnosis and Iterative Correction of `cascade-log.md`:**
1.  **Initial Problem:** The `cascade-log.md` file showed the pattern: `[Previous Log Content]\n\n---\n\n---\n\n*(End of Cascade Interaction Log...)*`.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   Cascade's drafted session summary (the content for "[Previous Log Content]") had inadvertently included a `---` at its very end.
    *   The AISP-002 procedure for appending logs (Step 9) correctly specifies that the `ReplacementContent` should be `\n\n---\n\n[NEW SUMMARY CONTENT]\n\n---\n\n*(Footer)*`. This means the append logic itself introduces a `---` separator before the new content and another one after it (which becomes the new separator before the footer).
    *   When the `[NEW SUMMARY CONTENT]` also ended with `---`, the sequence became `...summary_text---\n\n---\n\n*(Footer)*`, leading to the double separator.
3.  **Correction Attempts:**
    *   An initial `replace_file_content` attempt by Cascade to fix the `cascade-log.md` file was not perfectly accurate due to slight mismatches in the `TargetContent` argument, a common challenge when dealing with exact string replacements involving newlines and whitespace.
    *   Cascade used the `view_file` tool multiple times to inspect the precise problematic lines in `cascade-log.md`, ensuring the `TargetContent` for subsequent `replace_file_content` calls was an exact match of the erroneous section.
    *   After a few iterations, the `cascade-log.md` file was successfully corrected to the proper format: `[Log Content]\n\n---\n\n*(Footer)*`.

**Proactive Refinement of AISP-002:**
1.  **User Prompt for Reflection:** The USER astutely asked if AISP-002 itself needed an update to prevent this issue in the future.
2.  **Cascade's Analysis:**
    *   Cascade reviewed its internal instructions for AISP-002 (Memory ID `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`).
    *   It was determined that Step 6 ("Draft Summary") was the most appropriate place to introduce a preventative measure. The existing instruction was: "Compose a verbose, detailed Markdown summary... Structure logically, emphasizing 'why' and 'how.'"
3.  **Proposed Solution for AISP-002:**
    *   Cascade proposed modifying Step 6 to include an explicit instruction: "**Important: Ensure the drafted summary content itself does not end with a `---` Markdown horizontal rule, as the appending process (Step 9) will correctly add the necessary separator.**"
4.  **Implementation of AISP-002 Update:**
    *   The USER approved the proposed change.
    *   Cascade executed a `create_memory` tool call with `Action: "update"` to modify Memory ID `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`. The entire content of the memory was re-submitted with the updated Step 6.

**Outcome:**
*   The `cascade-log.md` file's formatting has been corrected.
*   The AISP-002 procedure within Cascade's operational memory has been enhanced to prevent the AI from drafting summaries that would lead to future separator duplication, making the logging process more robust.

**Files Modified:**
*   `design/cascade-log.md` (corrected formatting and new log entry added)
*   Memory `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf` (AISP-002 updated)

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 06:09 - Topic: F001 Spec Refinement

This session focused on the detailed review and refinement of the feature specification `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` to ensure its readiness for MVP development.

**Key Activities and Decisions:**

1.  **Initial Review:** `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` was reviewed to identify areas requiring clarification or further detail, aiming to align its quality with more recently updated specifications (F004-F007).
2.  **Identified Refinement Areas:** Several placeholders (e.g., `[NEEDS_DISCUSSION]`, `[NEEDS_DECISION]`) and areas for improvement were identified, including:
    *   Precise logic for identifying a "ship contract."
    *   Clarifications for data model fields (`contracts.start_location_name`, `contracts.volume`, `contract_items.record_id`).
    *   Definition of data model relationships and an initial indexing strategy.
    *   Specification of an ESI API error retry strategy.
    *   Definition of Hangar Bay API error response structures.
    *   Setting data freshness targets and incorporating a USER-requested feature for admin-triggered manual data refreshes.
    *   Strategy for handling contracts with numerous items.
    *   Clarifying database write strategies (individual vs. batch).
    *   Refining user story scope and updating acceptance criteria accordingly.
3.  **Discussion and Confirmation:** Proposed refinements for each identified area were presented to the USER. The USER provided feedback, notably requesting the inclusion of an admin-triggered manual data refresh capability, which was incorporated. All proposed changes were subsequently confirmed.
4.  **Document Update:** `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` was updated by applying all agreed-upon changes to resolve ambiguities and enhance the specification's completeness.

This process has significantly improved the clarity and detail of F001, making it a more robust guide for development.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 06:24 - Topic: F003 Spec Refinement

This session focused on the detailed review and refinement of the feature specification `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md`.

**Key Activities and Decisions:**

1.  **Initial Review:** `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md` was reviewed to identify areas for clarification and enhancement, ensuring alignment with other refined MVP features.
2.  **Identified Refinement Areas:** Minor refinements were proposed and accepted:
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Clarified Criterion 2.1 regarding the display of ship attributes by referencing Section 15's logic. Updated Criterion 3.1 to specify the source of `current_bid`. Added a new criterion for displaying 'Additional Included Items' based on the `contracts.contains_additional_items` flag and details from `contract_items`.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Ensured the `Success_Response_Schema_Ref` for `GET /api/v1/contracts/ships/{contract_id}` explicitly includes the `contains_additional_items` flag from the `contracts` table and covers all items (ship and non-ship).
    *   **UI/UX Considerations:** Added a point about clearly displaying 'Additional Included Items' in a distinct section.
    *   **Notes / Open Questions (Section 15):** Updated the note on 'Handling Multiple Items in a "Ship Contract"' to confirm that F003 will use the `contracts.contains_additional_items` flag already established in F001.
3.  **Discussion and Confirmation:** All proposed refinements were presented to and confirmed by the USER.
4.  **Document Update:** `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md` was updated by applying all agreed-upon changes, improving its precision for development.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F007-Alerts-Notifications.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F007 (Alerts/Notifications) to ensure clarity, completeness, and alignment with MVP scope.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **Notification Message Content:** Enhanced to include the contract type (e.g., "Auction", "ItemExchange") in addition to item name, price, and location. Example: 'Caracal (Auction) found for 10,500,000 ISK in Jita. View contract.'
*   **Data Model (`notifications` table):** The example for `message_params` was updated to include `contract_type` (e.g., `{ship_name: 'Caracal', price: '1000000 ISK', location: 'Jita', contract_type: 'Auction'}`) to support the enhanced message content.
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Criterion 1.2):** Clarified that the `max_price` for watchlist alerts is sourced from the user's setting on the specific watchlist item.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

---

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F006-Watchlists.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F006 (Watchlists).

**Key Refinements:**
*   **Data Model (`watchlist_items` table):** Clarified in the `AI_Action_Focus` for the `type_id` field that validation should confirm it is a valid, published **ship** type ID, typically by checking against the `esi_type_cache` for appropriate category/group ID. This ensures watchlists are focused on shiptypes for MVP.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

---

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F005-Saved-Searches.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F005 (Saved Searches), resolving open questions.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **MVP Scope:** Confirmed that for MVP, updating the underlying search criteria of an existing saved search is deferred. MVP supports creating, renaming, executing, and deleting saved searches.
*   **Open Questions Resolved (Notes Section Updated):**
    *   **Long Saved Search Names:** UI will likely use truncation with tooltips for display.
    *   **Limit on Saved Searches:** No hard limit per user for MVP.
    *   **Invalid Filter Options:** If a saved search contains filter options that become invalid over time (e.g., due to game updates), these will be silently ignored when the search is applied, rather than causing an error.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

---

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F004 (User Authentication - EVE SSO), clarifying several key aspects of the authentication flow and token management.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **ESI Scopes & Token Validation:** Clarified that no ESI scopes are requested during the authentication itself for F004's core purpose. User identification is derived from validating the ID token JWT locally using EVE SSO's JWKS URI. The ESI `/oauth/verify` endpoint is an optional secondary verification.
*   **Refresh Token Failure:** If a refresh token fails, the Hangar Bay session will be invalidated, tokens cleared, and the user prompted to re-login with a clear message.
*   **Session Duration:** Hangar Bay sessions will have a longer lifespan (e.g., 7 days), managed by secure, HTTPOnly cookies.
*   **Character Transfer Handling:** The `CharacterOwnerHash` will be stored and verified on each login. If a mismatch occurs (indicating a potential character transfer), existing user records will be updated or handled according to a defined policy to maintain data integrity.
*   **Open Redirect Prevention:** The `/auth/sso/login` endpoint will validate the optional `next` URL parameter to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 07:24 - Topic: Conceptualization and Initial Development of AI-Focused MVP Implementation Plan

**Objective:** To conceptualize, structure, and begin populating a detailed, AI-friendly MVP implementation plan for the Hangar Bay project. This plan is designed to guide AI coding assistants (like Cascade) and human developers through the development of MVP features (F001, F002, F003) in a clear, efficient, and context-aware manner.

**1. Rationale and Benefits of an AI-Focused Implementation Plan:**

The decision to create a highly structured, AI-focused implementation plan was driven by the recognition of several key benefits for a project utilizing AI-assisted development:

*   **Clarity and Reduced Ambiguity:** Explicit, step-by-step instructions, broken down into granular tasks, minimize guesswork for the AI and ensure development efforts are precisely targeted.
*   **Contextual Grounding:** Each task in the plan is designed to link directly to relevant project artifacts, including:
    *   Specific feature specifications (e.g., `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md`, `F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md`, `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md`).
    *   Core design documents (e.g., `design-spec.md`, `security-spec.md`).
    *   Specific sections or even data models within these documents.
    This rich contextual linking provides the AI with the necessary background to understand the "why" behind each task.
*   **Structured Prompts & AI Guidance:** The plan incorporates "AI Implementation Guidance" sections within each task file. These sections can embed or suggest effective prompts for code generation, updates, reviews, or specific questions to ask the USER, streamlining AI interaction.
*   **Dependency Management:** Clearly outlining task dependencies within and across phases helps ensure that code is generated and integrated in the correct logical order, preventing downstream issues.
*   **Testability Focus:** Integrating testing considerations, criteria, and references to `test-spec.md` directly into each task file ensures that testability is a primary concern from the outset of development for each component.
*   **Iterative Progress & Traceability:** Breaking down the MVP into smaller, manageable tasks, organized by phases, allows for iterative development, easier progress tracking, and more straightforward course correction if needed.
*   **Knowledge Persistence & Onboarding:** The plan itself becomes a valuable, living project artifact. It documents the "how" of the MVP build, serving as a reference for future development phases, new team members, or other AI instances.
*   **AI-Friendly Formatting:** The use of Markdown, checklists, clear headings, and concise language is intended to be easily parsable and understandable by AI agents.

**2. MVP Scope for Initial Plan:**

The initial MVP implementation plan focuses on the core features required for a functional Hangar Bay application, specifically:
*   **F001: Public Contract Aggregation & Display**
*   **F002: Ship Browsing & Advanced Search/Filtering**
*   **F003: Detailed Ship Contract View**

Crucially, these MVP features do not require user authentication (F004) for their core functionality, simplifying the initial development scope.

**3. Phased Approach and Initial Structure:**

A phased approach was adopted for the implementation plan to provide a logical flow and group related tasks. The high-level phases conceptualized, aligning with the detailed 11-phase plan, are:

*   **Phase 0: Foundational Setup:** Covers project initialization, tooling (linters, formatters), dependency management (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`), version control (`.gitignore`), and initial `README.md` updates. Includes configuration management setup (Pydantic Settings, Angular environment files).
*   **Phase 1: Backend Core Infrastructure:** Establishes the FastAPI application skeleton, database setup (PostgreSQL with Alembic for migrations, SQLite for dev), and Valkey caching layer integration.
*   **Phase 2: Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation:** Develops the ESI API client for public endpoints, defines SQLAlchemy models for F001 data (contracts, items, type cache, etc.), implements the background aggregation service, and creates initial API endpoints for basic contract listing.
*   **Phase 3: Frontend Core Infrastructure:** Sets up the Angular application skeleton, creates a backend API service layer in Angular, and implements the basic application layout, routing, and navigation.
*   **Phase 4: Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering:** Develops the Angular component for displaying the contract list (F001) and implements UI elements for basic filtering (initial F002).
*   **Phase 5: Backend - F002: Advanced Search & Filtering Logic:** Enhances backend query capabilities to support advanced filters defined in F002 and updates API endpoints accordingly.
*   **Phase 6: Frontend - F002: Advanced Filtering Implementation:** Develops the Angular component for the advanced search/filter interface and integrates it with the backend.
*   **Phase 7: Backend - F003: Detailed Ship/Contract View:** Creates API endpoint(s) to serve detailed information for a specific contract, including items and ship attributes, as per F003.
*   **Phase 8: Frontend - F003: Detailed View Implementation:** Develops the Angular component to display the detailed contract view.
*   **Phase 9: Cross-Cutting Concerns (Integrated Throughout & Finalized):** Addresses security hardening (MVP scope), logging and basic observability, testing (unit and basic E2E), and foundational accessibility & i18n stubs.
*   **Phase 10: Deployment:** Covers Dockerization of backend and frontend applications and setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline.

**4. Task File Granularity and Content:**

Each task within a phase is detailed in its own Markdown file. A standardized structure for these task files was envisioned, typically including:
*   Task ID and Title
*   Phase
*   Link to Parent Plan (Overview)
*   Last Updated Date
*   Objective: Clear statement of what the task aims to achieve.
*   Relevant Specifications: Links to specific sections in feature specs, design docs, etc.
*   Key Implementation Steps: A checklist of actions to be taken.
*   AI Implementation Guidance: Specific prompts, considerations, or questions for the AI.
*   Definition of Done: Clear criteria for when the task is considered complete.

**5. Initial File Creation and (Briefly Noted) Tooling Challenges:**

*   An overview file, `plans/implementation/00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md`, was created to list all phases and tasks, with intended links to nested task files (e.g., `phase-00-foundational-setup/00.1-task-name.md`).
*   The first two task files for Phase 00 were then created:
    *   `00.1-project-initialization-tooling.md`
    *   `00.2-configuration-management.md`
*   (A brief operational note: Initial attempts to create these files directly in their nested subdirectories encountered tool limitations with on-the-fly directory creation. A temporary flat-file structure was used, and then reverted to the preferred nested structure once the USER manually created the subdirectories. This operational detail, while logged, is secondary to the strategic planning of the content itself.)

**Significance & Next Steps:**
This detailed, AI-focused implementation plan provides a robust framework for developing the Hangar Bay MVP. It prioritizes clarity, context, and iterative progress, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of AI-assisted development. The next steps involve continuing to populate the detailed task files for each phase according to this structure and then executing the plan.

Clarified that the Pydantic model instance will be passed to the service layer for dynamic query building.

All Phase 05 task files are now considered consistent with F002.

---

## Phase 07: Backend - F003: Detailed Ship/Contract View - Review Summary (2025-06-06)

Reviewed and updated the task file within Phase 07 to ensure alignment with the F003 feature specification:
*   **07.1-api-endpoints-f003.md:** Updated the API endpoint route to `GET /api/v1/contracts/ships/{contract_id}`. Revised Pydantic response model AI prompts to define `ShipContractDetailRead` (for the overall contract) and `ContractItemDetailRead` (for nested items), including comprehensive fields and resolved names (e.g., `type_name`, `group_name`, `location_name`). Refined the FastAPI endpoint handler AI prompt to include verification of `is_ship_contract`, eager loading, name/detail resolution from `EsiTypeCache` and other sources, and returning the `ShipContractDetailRead` model.

The Phase 07 task file is now considered consistent with F003.

---

## Phase 03: Frontend Core Infrastructure - Review Summary (2025-06-06)

Reviewed and updated all task files within Phase 03:

*   **03.2-backend-api-service-layer.md:** Refined the "Implement Initial API Methods" section and its AI prompt. Clarified that initial methods should target the F001 endpoint `/api/v1/contracts/ships`. Updated the example method signature and AI prompt to reflect F001 query parameters (`page`, `size`, `ship_type_id`, `is_bpc`) and the `PaginatedShipContractsResponse` (containing `ShipContract` items aligned with `ShipContractRead` Pydantic schema).
*   **03.3-basic-layout-routing.md:** Updated the "Define Initial Routes" section to specify a single primary route (`/browse-contracts`) for displaying ship contracts, serving both F001 and F002. The default route will redirect here. Adjusted placeholder component generation and AI prompt for the `Routes` array accordingly. Updated "Implement Basic Navigation" to reflect this single primary navigation link.

All Phase 03 task files are now considered internally consistent and aligned with related feature specifications.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 09:16:09-05:00 - AISP-002 Timestamp Clarification & Phase 04 Task Refinement

This session focused on clarifying AI operational procedures regarding timestamp formats and continuing with the Hangar Bay MVP frontend task plan validation.

**Key Activities and Decisions:**

1.  **AISP-002 Timestamp Clarification (Iterative Process):**
    *   The AI System Procedure `AISP-002` (documented in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`) underwent updates to specify the precise timestamp format for entries in `design/cascade-log.md`.
    *   Initially, it was updated to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ` (U.S. Central Time).
    *   Following USER clarification regarding ambiguity between 'Z' (Zulu) and the "U.S. Central Time" hint, AISP-002 was further corrected.
    *   The **final and correct** required format for session summary headings is now `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS±hh:mm` (U.S. Central Time with offset, e.g., `2025-06-06 09:16:09-05:00`), aligning with the intended interpretation of the instruction in `design-log.md`.

2.  **Operational Memory Update (AISP-002):**
    *   The associated Cascade Memory (ID: `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`), which operationalizes AISP-002 for AI-assisted session summary logging, was updated in line with the final timestamp format clarification.
    *   Specifically, Action Step 6 of the memory now reflects the corrected timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS±hh:mm` (U.S. Central Time with offset).

3.  **Cascade Log File Management:**
    *   The redundant `cascade-log.md` file at the project root (`c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\cascade-log.md`) was successfully deleted, following earlier consolidation of its content into `design/cascade-log.md`.

4.  **Phase 04 Frontend Task Refinement (`04.1-contract-list-component.md`):**
    *   The task file `plans/implementation/phase-04-frontend-f001-f002-contract-listing-basic-filtering/04.1-contract-list-component.md` was reviewed and refined.
    *   Key clarifications included:
        *   The `ContractListComponent` generated in this task will be the primary component for the `/browse-contracts` route, explicitly replacing the `BrowseContractsPageComponent` placeholder defined in Phase 03 (Task 03.3).
        *   A note was added regarding the Angular CLI's `--flat` option for component generation, explaining its effect on directory structure.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed with reviewing the next task file in Phase 04: `04.2-basic-filtering-ui.md`.

---

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 09:32:17-05:00 - Topic: Creation of Task 04.3 and MVP Plan Update

**Session Goal:** To continue reviewing Phase 04 frontend implementation tasks and address any discrepancies in the MVP plan.

**Key Activities & Decisions:**

1.  **Identification of Missing Task:**
    *   While reviewing the `00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md`, it was noted that Phase 04 ("Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering") listed tasks `04.1-contract-list-component.md` and `04.2-basic-filtering-ui.md`.
    *   However, a logical next step – integrating the filters with the list – was not explicitly defined as a separate task (e.g., `04.3`).
    *   It was determined that for clarity and to ensure all steps are explicitly documented for AI-assisted development, a dedicated task for this integration was necessary.

2.  **Creation of Task `04.3-integrating-filters-with-list.md`:**
    *   A new task file, `plans/implementation/phase-04-frontend-f001-f002-contract-listing-basic-filtering/04.3-integrating-filters-with-list.md`, was created.
    *   **Objective:** To integrate the basic filtering UI (Task 04.2) with the `ContractListComponent` (Task 04.1), involving capturing filter changes, updating API request parameters, and refreshing the contract list.
    *   **Content:** The file includes:
        *   Relevant specifications (F001, design-spec, Tasks 04.1, 04.2, 03.2, 02.4).
        *   Key implementation steps: Modifying `ContractListComponent`, updating API call logic (with pagination reset), triggering data refresh, and integrating the filter component.
        *   AI implementation guidance and specific AI prompts.
        *   A comprehensive Definition of Done.
    *   The "Last Updated" date within the new task file was set to `2025-06-07` (reflecting the intended date of creation for the file content).

3.  **Update to `00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md`:**
    *   The `00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md` file was modified to include a reference to the new task:
        ```diff
        ### Phase 4: Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering
        *   **Goal:** Develop the UI for displaying contracts and implementing initial filtering capabilities.
        *   **Tasks:**
            *   [04.1 Contract List Component](./phase-04-frontend-f001-f002-contract-listing-basic-filtering/04.1-contract-list-component.md)
            *   [04.2 Basic Filtering UI](./phase-04-frontend-f001-f002-contract-listing-basic-filtering/04.2-basic-filtering-ui.md)
        +    *   [04.3 Integrating Basic Filters with Contract List](./phase-04-frontend-f001-f002-contract-listing-basic-filtering/04.3-integrating-filters-with-list.md)

## Cascade Log: 2025-06-06 - Integrating Cross-Cutting Concerns Proactively

**Session ID:** HangarBay-MVP-Review-20250606-CCC-Integration
**User:** Sam
**Cascade Version:** Cascade Agentic AI Coding Assistant (Windsurf/AI Flow Paradigm) - 2025-06-06
**Objective:** Address the critical process issue of ensuring cross-cutting concerns (Security, Observability, Testing, Accessibility, Internationalization) are integrated throughout the Hangar Bay MVP development lifecycle, rather than being treated as an afterthought in Phase 09.

**1. Problem Identification:**

The USER (Sam) identified a significant flaw in the MVP implementation plan. While Phase 09 ("Cross-Cutting Concerns (MVP Scope)") correctly detailed tasks for Security, Observability, Testing, Accessibility, and Internationalization, these foundational aspects were not explicitly cross-referenced or mandated for integration within the preceding feature development phases (Phases 00-08). This risked these critical non-functional requirements (NFRs) being overlooked until late in the development cycle, potentially leading to:
    *   Increased rework and refactoring.
    *   Inherent security vulnerabilities.
    *   Poor observability and diagnosability.
    *   Inadequate test coverage developed reactively.
    *   Accessibility issues requiring significant UI changes.
    *   Difficulties in future internationalization efforts.

The USER emphasized: "Those CANNOT be an afterthought only looked at after much of the MVP is already built." This highlighted the need for a robust mechanism to ensure these concerns are an integral part of *every* task from the outset.

**2. Proposal Generation & Evaluation:**

To address this, I (Cascade) considered several potential solutions:

*   **Proposal 1: Modify All Existing Task Files:**
    *   *Description:* Add explicit references and checklist items for each cross-cutting concern to every task file in Phases 01-08.
    *   *Pros:* Highly explicit; difficult for an AI assistant to miss if processing the task file directly.
    *   *Cons:* Involves a large number of edits (19 files); could make individual task files overly verbose and repetitive. Maintenance could be cumbersome if the core specs for cross-cutting concerns evolve.

*   **Proposal 2: Create New "Gate" Sub-Tasks:**
    *   *Description:* For each existing feature task, introduce new, smaller sub-tasks specifically dedicated to reviewing and implementing aspects of each of the five cross-cutting concerns.
    *   *Pros:* Makes the consideration of NFRs a formal part of the workflow; explicitly allocates effort.
    *   *Cons:* Significantly increases the total number of tasks in the plan; could make the overall plan feel overly fragmented and bureaucratic. Might lead to NFRs still being seen as separate rather than intrinsically part of the feature work.

*   **Proposal 3: Leverage Cascade's Memory System:**
    *   *Description:* Create strong, high-priority memories instructing me to *always* consult and apply the cross-cutting specifications (`security-spec.md`, `observability-spec.md`, etc.) for any Hangar Bay task.
    *   *Pros:* Powerful for directly influencing my (Cascade's) behavior and reasoning processes. Doesn't clutter project files with boilerplate. Leverages the agentic nature of Cascade.
    *   *Cons:* Relies heavily on the effectiveness and consistent application of the memory system. Less visible to a human developer reviewing only the task files. Might be harder to verify that the consideration happened for each task without explicit output.

*   **Proposal 4: Global Reminder in Overview Plan:**
    *   *Description:* Add a prominent global instruction in `00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md` emphasizing the importance of integrating NFRs throughout.
    *   *Pros:* Simple to implement; provides a high-level directive.
    *   *Cons:* Likely too high-level and easily overlooked when an AI assistant (or human) is focused on the specifics of an individual task file. Lacks actionable enforcement.

*   **Proposal 5: Hybrid Approach (Chosen):**
    *   *Description:* Combine the strengths of AI Memories, a standardized checklist within each task file, and a global reminder in the overview plan.
    *   *Pros:*
        *   **AI Memories:** Directly influence Cascade's core processing to prioritize NFRs.
        *   **Standardized Checklist:** Provides an explicit, actionable step within each task file, making the NFR consideration visible and verifiable. Forces active thought about NFRs in the context of *that specific task*.
        *   **Global Reminder:** Reinforces the importance at the project plan level.
        *   Offers a multi-layered approach, increasing the likelihood of consistent NFR integration.
    *   *Cons:* Requires initial setup effort for memories and modifying all relevant task files. The checklist adds some boilerplate to each task, but its value outweighs this.

**3. Decision & Justification:**

The Hybrid Approach (Proposal 5) was chosen as the most effective and robust solution for ensuring Cascade consistently addresses cross-cutting concerns.
    *   **Effectiveness for AI (Cascade):** The AI Memories directly tap into my operational paradigm. The explicit checklist in each task file provides a concrete, structured prompt that I am designed to follow. This combination ensures both implicit understanding (via memory) and explicit instruction (via checklist).
    *   **Verifiability:** The checklist in each task file, which I will be responsible for filling out, provides a clear record that these concerns were considered for each specific piece of work.
    *   **Maintainability:** While requiring initial edits, the core NFR specifications remain centralized. The checklist points to these central documents.
    *   **User Confidence:** This multi-pronged strategy provides greater assurance to the USER that these critical aspects will not be overlooked.

The chosen strategy is:
1.  **Create Strong AI Memories:** Instructing Cascade that for any Hangar Bay task, the specifications for Security, Observability, Testing, Accessibility, and Internationalization are primary, non-negotiable inputs. (Completed via `create_memory` tool calls).
2.  **Standardized "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" Section in Each Task File (Phases 00-08):** A new, mandatory checklist section to be added to each task file, requiring Cascade to detail how each concern was addressed for that specific task.
3.  **Global Reinforcement in `00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md`:** A note explaining this integrated approach.

**4. Outcome:**

This combined strategy ensures these critical areas are not deferred but are an integral part of Cascade's workflow for every task, from planning through implementation. The goal is to build quality, security, and maintainability into Hangar Bay from the very first line of code.

**5. Action Plan (as of this log entry):**
1.  Create the AI memories (Completed).
2.  Append this log entry to `design/cascade-log.md` and a summary to `design/design-log.md` (Current step).
3.  Update `00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md` with the global reinforcement note.
4.  Systematically update all task files in Phases 00-08 to include the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" checklist.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 11:16 - Topic: Hangar Bay MVP Implementation Strategy and Plan

**Objective:** To evaluate proposals for implementing the Hangar Bay MVP, select the most effective approach, and define an initial implementation plan, incorporating a revised project directory structure.

**1. Revised Project Directory Structure:**

The USER confirmed a change to the project's directory structure for application code:
*   Backend source code will reside in: `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\backend`
*   Frontend source code will reside in: `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\frontend`
This `app/` parent directory neatly separates application code from `design/` and `plans/` directories. This structure is standard and poses no anticipated issues, provided all path configurations (e.g., `PYTHONPATH`, Docker contexts, Angular project paths) are set accordingly.

**2. Evaluation of MVP Implementation Proposals:**

Three primary proposals for sequencing the Hangar Bay MVP implementation were considered:

*   **Proposal A: Foundational Setup & Backend Core First**
    *   **Description:** Prioritize establishing the project's foundational elements (tooling, configuration, directory structure) and then building the core backend infrastructure (FastAPI skeleton, database, caching). Frontend development would follow once backend APIs begin to stabilize.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Builds a robust and stable foundation for the rest of the application.
        *   Allows for early definition and stabilization of backend APIs, which are critical dependencies for the frontend.
        *   Leverages AI strengths effectively for generating boilerplate code, configurations, and initial backend logic.
        *   Reduces cognitive load by tackling backend complexities before introducing UI/UX development.
        *   Facilitates easier integration of cross-cutting concerns (security, observability, testing) from the ground up in the backend.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   User-visible features are delayed compared to other approaches.
        *   Feedback on UI/UX will come later in the development cycle.

*   **Proposal B: End-to-End Thin Slice**
    *   **Description:** Implement a single, simple user-facing feature (e.g., displaying a list of public contracts with minimal filtering) from the frontend through to the backend and database.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Provides early validation of the entire technology stack and inter-component communication.
        *   Delivers a tangible, albeit limited, piece of working software quickly, which can be motivating.
        *   Allows for early identification of integration challenges.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   May lead to premature optimization or over-simplification of core backend services if not carefully managed.
        *   Could result in foundational aspects (like comprehensive configuration or robust error handling) being underdeveloped initially.
        *   Risk of throwaway work if the "thin slice" doesn't align well with broader architectural needs that emerge later.

*   **Proposal C: Frontend First with Mock Backend**
    *   **Description:** Focus on developing the frontend UI components and user experience, using a mocked backend API for data and interactions.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Allows for rapid iteration on UI/UX design based on visual feedback.
        *   Enables parallel development if separate teams/individuals work on frontend and backend.
        *   Can gather user feedback on the interface early in the process.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   The mock backend may not accurately represent the eventual capabilities, constraints, or performance characteristics of the real backend, leading to rework.
        *   Integration with the real backend can be complex and time-consuming later.
        *   Delays validation of critical backend logic and data models.

**3. Conclusion and Rationale for Proposal A:**

After careful consideration, **Proposal A (Foundational Setup & Backend Core First)** was selected as the most effective and strategic approach for the Hangar Bay MVP.

*   **Rationale for Selection:**
    *   **Stability and Robustness:** Prioritizing foundational elements ensures that the project is built on a solid architectural and technical base. This is crucial for long-term maintainability, scalability, and security.
    *   **Reduced Risk:** Addressing backend complexities and API design early mitigates the risk of significant rework later in the project. A well-defined backend provides a clear contract for frontend development.
    *   **Effective AI Utilization:** This approach aligns well with AI capabilities, allowing Cascade to assist significantly with boilerplate generation, configuration setup, initial data modeling, and API endpoint creation.
    *   **Systematic Integration of Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Building the backend first allows for the systematic integration of security, observability, and testing practices from the outset, rather than trying to retrofit them later.
    *   **Alignment with Project Phase Structure:** This approach naturally fits the existing phased plan, starting logically with Phase 00 and Phase 01.

While user-visible features are deferred slightly, the long-term benefits of a strong foundation and well-defined backend are deemed to outweigh the desire for immediate UI deliverables.

**4. Implementation Plan for Proposal A (Phases 00 & 01):**

The initial implementation will focus on completing tasks outlined in Phase 00 and Phase 01. The general workflow for each task will be:
1.  **Announce Task:** Cascade/USER clearly states the task to be undertaken.
2.  **Implement & Propose:** Cascade proposes and/or generates code, configuration, or documentation.
3.  **Review & Iterate:** USER reviews the proposal, provides feedback, and Cascade iterates until satisfactory.
4.  **Cross-Cutting Concerns Review:** For tasks involving code or significant configuration, the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" checklist in the relevant `.md` task file (or a similar review for non-task-file work) will be completed.
5.  **Commit Changes:** Once approved and reviewed, changes are committed.

*   **Phase 00: Foundational Setup**
    *   **Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling Setup:**
        *   Initialize Git repository if not already fully set up.
        *   Configure linters (e.g., Pylint, Flake8 for Python; ESLint, Prettier for Angular/TypeScript).
        *   Set up code formatters (e.g., Black for Python; Prettier for Angular/TypeScript).
        *   Implement pre-commit hooks (e.g., using `pre-commit` framework) to enforce linting and formatting.
        *   Provide/update IDE configuration files (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json`) for consistent development environments.
        *   Update `README.md` with detailed development setup instructions.
        *   Establish `app/backend` and `app/frontend` directories.
    *   **Task 00.2: Configuration Management:**
        *   Design and implement a centralized configuration management strategy (e.g., using Pydantic settings for FastAPI, environment files for Angular).
        *   Ensure clear separation of configurations for different environments (development, testing, production).
        *   Define a strategy for managing secrets (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets manager for production).

*   **Phase 01: Backend Core Infrastructure (`app/backend`)**
    *   **Task 01.1: FastAPI Application Skeleton:**
        *   Create the basic FastAPI application structure within `app/backend`.
        *   Set up the main application file (e.g., `main.py`).
        *   Organize initial API routers (e.g., for future authentication, core data).
        *   Implement basic dependency injection patterns.
        *   Include initial `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with FastAPI, Uvicorn.
    *   **Task 01.2: Database Setup:**
        *   Integrate SQLAlchemy for ORM.
        *   Define initial SQLAlchemy models for core entities (e.g., Users, Contracts - based on F001, F004).
        *   Set up Alembic for database migrations.
        *   Configure database connections for SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production).
        *   Create initial migration scripts.
    *   **Task 01.3: Cache Integration:**
        *   Set up Valkey client library.
        *   Implement a basic caching service or utility functions for use within the FastAPI application.
        *   Define initial caching strategies for ESI responses or frequently accessed data.

**Next Steps:**
Proceed with the execution of Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling Setup.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-07 20:19 - Topic: Resolution of File Creation Tooling Issues

**Objective:** To diagnose and establish a reliable workaround for the `write_to_file` tool's inability to create parent directories when writing new files, which was causing repeated failures.

**Background:**
Throughout the session, attempts to create new files (e.g., `__init__.py`, `config.py`) in new subdirectories using the `write_to_file` tool consistently failed with "path not found" errors. This was because the tool does not create parent directories if they do not already exist. This necessitated multiple requests for the USER to manually create directories, hindering workflow efficiency.

**Investigation and Workaround Testing:**
The USER proposed two methods to address this:
1.  **Multi-step `write_to_file`:** Attempting to create directories by writing `__init__.py` files sequentially. This was tested (e.g., trying to create `test/__init__.py`) and failed, confirming the tool cannot create even the first level of a new directory. This method was deemed non-viable without a dedicated directory creation tool.
2.  **PowerShell `New-Item` Command:** Using the native Windows PowerShell command `New-Item -Path <path_to_file> -ItemType File -Force`. This was tested by creating `test\powershell\test.txt`.

**Test Results & Resolution:**
*   The PowerShell command `New-Item -Path .\test\powershell\test.txt -ItemType File -Force` (executed from the project root) successfully created the `test.txt` file and its parent directories (`test` and `powershell`) as needed.
*   **Decision:** The PowerShell `New-Item` command was adopted as the standard workaround for Cascade to create new files when parent directories might not exist in this Windows development environment.

**Future Action & Memory:**
*   Cascade will utilize the `New-Item -Path <full_path_to_file_including_filename> -ItemType File -Force` command going forward for such scenarios.
*   A persistent memory (ID: `0fedc6fd-b139-4dd6-870a-175ed12facad`) was created to document this workaround and ensure its consistent application. This memory has also been indexed in `design/memory-index.md`.

**Impact:** This resolution is expected to significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of file creation operations, reducing interruptions and manual interventions.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-07 21:07:57-05:00 - Topic: Backend Directory Structure Recommendation

The following directory structure was recommended for `app/backend/`:

```text
app/
└── backend/
    ├── .venv/                  # Virtual environment for the backend (gitignored)
    ├── docker/                 # Docker-specific files for the backend
    │   └── Dockerfile          # Example
    ├── src/                    # Python source code for the backend
    │   ├── __init__.py         # Makes 'src' a package
    │   └── fastapi/            # Your FastAPI application package
    │       ├── __init__.py     # Makes 'fastapi' a sub-package
    │       ├── main.py         # FastAPI app instance
    │       ├── config.py       # Pydantic settings
    │       ├── routers/        # Directory for API routers
    │       ├── models/         # Directory for Pydantic models or SQLAlchemy models
    │       └── services/       # Directory for business logic
    ├── __init__.py             # Makes 'backend' a package (useful if app/ is a project root)
    ├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies for the backend
    └── tests/                  # Tests for the backend (often outside src)
```

This structure promotes clear separation of source code, configuration, and environment-specific files, aligning with common Python project best practices, particularly when using a `src` layout.

**Topic:** Creation of AI Memory for Task Checklist Update Procedure

**Details:**
During the session, a need was identified for a consistent procedure for AI assistants to update task checklists in Markdown-based planning documents (`plans/implementation/**/*.md`). This arose from observing inconsistencies in how checklist items were being marked as complete.

To address this, the following AI memory was proposed and subsequently created (System-Assigned ID: `3c3ce4a0-7e80-4d2d-ab24-c48e4071d8fe`):

```markdown
Cascade Memory for Task Checklist Update Procedure

Here's a proposed memory for handling task checklist updates:

* UUID: a3c8f5b1-0e6d-4a9b-82f7-1d4c0e8a7b3c
* Title: Procedure: Updating Task Checklists in Implementation Plans
* Content: "When a specific task or sub-task within an implementation plan (plans/implementation/**/*.md) is completed, AI assistants (like Cascade) MUST update its corresponding Markdown checklist item from [ ] to [x]. If subsequent actions or new information invalidates a previously completed item, it MUST be reverted from [x] back to [ ], and the USER MUST be explicitly notified of this change and the reason for it. This procedure ensures that task planning documents accurately reflect the current project state and maintain their reliability as a source of truth for progress tracking."
* Tags: ai_procedure, project_management, task_tracking, documentation_maintenance
* CorpusNames: scarson/hangar-bay (or make it global if preferred for all projects)

Justification for Effectiveness: This memory would be effective because:

* Clarity and Simplicity: It provides a straightforward rule ([ ] to [x]).
* Consistency: It ensures all AI interactions with checklists follow the same pattern.
* Reversibility and Notification: Crucially, it includes a process for unchecking items if they become invalid due to new work or discoveries, and mandates USER notification. This prevents planning documents from becoming stale or misleading.
* Reliability: By enforcing this, the task plans remain a reliable source of truth for project progress.
* Accountability: The notification requirement for unchecking items ensures transparency.

**Date:** 2025-06-07 23:15:00-05:00
**Topic:** Creation of AI Memory for "Procedure: AI-Assisted Cross-Cutting Concerns (CCC) Review"

**Details:**
A new AI memory (ID: `0c495baf-94e6-4dfa-81c1-a386d94c813e`) titled "Procedure: AI-Assisted Cross-Cutting Concerns (CCC) Review" was created to provide a systematic approach for Cascade to complete the CCC review section in task files. This procedure ensures comprehensive consideration of security, observability, testing, accessibility, and internationalization by referencing their respective specification documents and relevant existing memories.

**Full Memory Content (ID: `0c495baf-94e6-4dfa-81c1-a386d94c813e`):**
```markdown
This procedure guides Cascade in completing the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section found in Hangar Bay task files (typically located in `plans/implementation/**/*.md`).

1.  **Locate CCC Section:** Identify the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section in the current task file. Confirm it aligns with the standard checklist structure (Security, Observability, Testing, Accessibility, Internationalization/I18n) as defined in Memory `f918edd9-8b47-4513-a287-f406c91aa5d3`. Note the requirement for dynamic section numbering.

2.  **Iterate Through Each Major Concern:** For each of the five major concerns (Security, Observability, Testing, Accessibility, I18n):
    a.  **Recall Guiding Documents & Memories:** For the specific concern being addressed, actively retrieve and consider its primary specification document and any relevant operational memories. The primary specification documents are:
        *   Security: `design/security-spec.md`
        *   Observability: `design/observability-spec.md`
        *   Testing: `design/test-spec.md`
        *   Accessibility: `design/accessibility-spec.md`
        *   Internationalization (I18n): `design/i18n-spec.md`
        *(Note: These paths are relative to the project root; adjust as needed if interpreting from a task file in a subdirectory, similar to the CCC checklist itself.)*
        Also consider general memories like `MEMORY[9602a185-4f44-49a6-852a-c02ef9500421]` (overall CCC mandate) and concern-specific memories (e.g., `MEMORY[82552343-47c2-4a12-8ff7-9503cbe70bf5]` for secrets management under Security).
    b.  **Analyze Task Context Against Concern:** Evaluate the specific work, code, or documentation produced or planned within the current task. Assess how the principles and requirements of the current CCC apply to this specific task context.
    c.  **Address Checklist Sub-Items:** For each sub-item listed under the current major concern (e.g., for Security: "Secure Design," "Input Validation," etc.):
        i.  Determine if the sub-item is applicable to the work done in the current task.
        ii. If applicable, briefly describe *how* it was addressed or *will be* addressed by the task's deliverables. If already implemented, point to specific code, configurations, or documentation.
        iii. If not applicable to this specific task, provide a brief justification.
        iv. Based on the assessment, mark the checklist item as `[x]` (addressed/considered/NA with justification) or leave as `[ ]` if it represents an outstanding action for *this task* that needs USER attention or will be explicitly deferred to a *different, specified* future task.
    d.  **Populate "Notes" Section:** In the "Notes" sub-section for the current major concern, provide a concise summary. This should include:
        i.  Key actions taken related to this concern for the task.
        ii. Specific considerations or trade-offs made (if any).
        iii. Rationale for any sub-items marked N/A or left unchecked (e.g., "N/A as this task involves backend logic only, no UI changes for Accessibility").
        iv. References to specific files, functions, or design decisions where the concern was implemented or documented.

3.  **Completeness and Consistency Check:** After iterating through all five CCCs, review the entire filled-out section for completeness, clarity, and consistency with the work performed in the task. Ensure all checklist items and notes accurately reflect the task's engagement with each concern.

4.  **USER Collaboration and Iteration:** Present the drafted "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" section to the USER. Clearly state that this is a draft for review. Be prepared to discuss, clarify, and make revisions based on USER feedback. The goal is a collaborative and accurate reflection of how CCCs were managed for the task.

5.  **Adherence to Specific Mandates:** Throughout the process, ensure strict adherence to any specific mandates within existing memories, such as the secrets management verification detailed in `MEMORY[82552343-47c2-4a12-8ff7-9503cbe70bf5]`.
```

**Justification for Effectiveness:**
*   Systematic Process: Provides a structured, step-by-step workflow for me to follow, ensuring no major concern or sub-item is accidentally overlooked.
*   Explicit Reference to Authority: Mandates recalling and using the specific spec documents (security-spec.md, etc.) and relevant existing memories, ensuring my review is based on established project standards rather than general knowledge.
*   Contextual Application: Requires me to analyze the current task's specific work against each CCC, promoting relevant and targeted feedback rather than generic statements.
*   Action-Oriented Documentation: The "Notes" section encourages documenting how things were done or why they weren't applicable, which is valuable for future reviews and understanding.
*   Facilitates Collaboration: Explicitly includes a step for presenting the draft to you for review and iteration, reinforcing the collaborative nature of these important reviews.
*   Builds on Existing Framework: Leverages and integrates with the existing CCC checklist template (Memory f918edd9-8b47-4513-a287-f406c91aa5d3) and the general mandate to address CCCs (Memory 9602a185-4f44-49a6-852a-c02ef9500421), providing the detailed operational how-to.
*   Reduces AI Cognitive Load: By breaking down a complex review into manageable steps, it helps ensure a more reliable and consistent output from me.
This proposed memory procedure aims to make my process for completing the "Cross-Cutting Concerns Review" more robust, transparent, and aligned with your project's quality standards.

This memory was indexed in `design/memory-index.md`.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-07 23:49 - Topic: Project-Wide Dependency Version Pinning Policy and Implementation Details

**Objective:** To formalize and document the requirement for pinning dependencies across the entire Hangar Bay project, ensuring stability, reproducibility, and predictability in builds.

**Key Discussion Points & Decisions:**

1.  **Acknowledgement of Importance:** Confirmed that pinning dependencies is a crucial best practice and should be a standard policy for the Hangar Bay project.

2.  **Areas Requiring Dependency Pinning:**
    *   **Backend (Python - `app/backend/requirements.txt`):** Already partially addressed by pinning FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic. This practice should be maintained for all backend Python dependencies.
    *   **Frontend (Angular - JavaScript/TypeScript):**
        *   **`package.json`:** All Node.js dependencies (e.g., Angular framework, UI libraries, build tools, linters) listed in `dependencies` and `devDependencies` must have their versions explicitly pinned.
        *   **Lock Files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`):** The relevant lock file, which captures the exact versions of all direct and transitive dependencies, MUST be committed to the repository. This is critical for ensuring identical installations across all environments.
    *   **Containerization (Docker - `Dockerfile`s):**
        *   **Base Images:** When specifying base images (e.g., `FROM python:...` or `FROM node:...`), specific version tags (e.g., `python:3.11.4-slim-buster`, `node:18.17.0-alpine`) must be used instead of general tags like `:latest` or minor version tags (e.g., `:3.11`).
        *   **Package Installations within Dockerfiles:** If OS-level packages (e.g., via `apt-get install -y <package>`, `apk add <package>`) or other tools are installed within Dockerfiles, their versions should also be pinned if the package manager supports it (e.g., `apt-get install -y mypackage=1.2.3`).
    *   **Development Dependencies:**
        *   For both backend and frontend, development-specific tools (e.g., linters, test runners, code generators) should also have their versions pinned. This is typically managed in `requirements-dev.txt` for Python or within `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
    *   **Database System (PostgreSQL):**
        *   While not pinned in a project file in the same way, the major version of the PostgreSQL server software (e.g., PostgreSQL 15.x) should be a deliberate choice and kept consistent across development, testing, and production environments to avoid compatibility issues. Database schema versions are managed by Alembic migrations, which are versioned.

3.  **Areas Where Pinning is Handled Differently or Less Critical:**
    *   **External Third-Party APIs:** For integrations with external services (like EVE ESI), use versioned API endpoints if offered by the provider (e.g., `https://esi.evetech.net/v2/...`). This is about choosing a specific version of an external contract rather than pinning a local library.
    *   **Local Developer Tooling:** Versions of IDEs, text editors, or global command-line utilities on a developer's machine are generally not pinned by the project, though team conventions might exist.

4.  **Actions Taken:**
    *   An AI Memory (`4b806f4d-8600-46c6-b939-f373f67f3c50`) titled "Policy: Project-Wide Dependency Version Pinning" was created to reinforce this policy for Cascade.
    *   The [design/memory-index.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Sam/OneDrive/Documents/Code/hangar-bay/design/memory-index.md:0:0-0:0) was updated with an entry for this new AI memory.
    *   The [design/design-spec.md](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Sam/OneDrive/Documents/Code/hangar-bay/design/design-spec.md:0:0-0:0) was updated by adding a new subsection `6.0. Dependency and Versioning Policy` under "Section 6: Tech Stack" to formally document this requirement for human developers and AI.

**Rationale for Policy:**
*   Ensures reproducible builds.
*   Prevents unexpected breaking changes from automatic dependency updates.
*   Stabilizes dependency resolution.
*   Enhances security by providing a clear baseline for vulnerability management.
*   Simplifies debugging.
*   Provides a clear manifest of the application's software components.

This comprehensive approach to dependency version pinning is vital for the long-term stability and maintainability of the Hangar Bay project.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-08 00:04 - Topic: Justification for `CONTRIBUTING.md` vs. `design-spec.md`

**Objective:** To discuss and evaluate the rationale for creating a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, distinct from `design/design-spec.md`, to document development practices for the Hangar Bay project.

**Key Discussion Points & Decisions:**

The following points were discussed regarding the separation of concerns between `design/design-spec.md` and a new `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

Yes, a `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or a similarly named file like `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`) would cover items sufficiently distinct from `design/design-spec.md` to justify it being a separate file.

Here's why, considering the impact on both humans and AI:

**1. Different Focus and Audience:**

*   **`design/design-spec.md` (The "What" and "Why"):**
    *   **Purpose:** Outlines the project's architecture, core design decisions, technical stack choices, feature specifications, security principles, accessibility standards, and other high-level strategic aspects. It explains *what* the system is, *why* it's designed that way, and the *goals* it aims to achieve.
    *   **Audience:** Architects, lead developers, product owners, and AI assistants (like Cascade) needing to understand the system's blueprint and foundational principles.
    *   **Content Nature:** More conceptual, architectural, and relatively stable (though it evolves).

*   **`CONTRIBUTING.md` (The "How"):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides practical, actionable instructions and conventions for the day-to-day development process. It details *how* to contribute code, set up the environment, follow coding standards, and use project workflows.
    *   **Audience:** All developers (new and existing, human and AI) actively writing, testing, or reviewing code. It's the go-to guide for operational development tasks.
    *   **Content Nature:** More procedural, tactical, and potentially more dynamic (e.g., specific commands, tool versions, or PR templates might change more frequently than core architectural principles).

**2. Distinct Content Categories:**

A `CONTRIBUTING.md` would typically include:

*   **Environment Setup:** Detailed steps for getting a local development environment running (e.g., specific Node/Python versions, virtualenv setup, database initialization, installing dependencies, running dev servers).
*   **Coding Standards:** Specific code style rules (e.g., line length, naming conventions for variables/functions/classes, commenting best practices), beyond just stating "use a linter."
*   **Version Control Workflow:** Branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, feature branches), commit message conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits), Pull Request (PR) procedures (templates, review expectations, CI checks).
*   **Testing Procedures:** How to run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; expectations for test coverage; where to add new tests.
*   **Dependency Management:** Practical steps for adding or updating dependencies, regenerating lock files.
*   **Tooling:** Specific commands for linters, formatters, build tools, and any project-specific scripts.
*   **Issue Tracking:** How to report bugs, suggest features, use labels in the issue tracker.
*   **Code Review Guidelines:** What reviewers should look for, how to provide constructive feedback.

While `design-spec.md` might *mention* that we use linters or have a testing strategy, `CONTRIBUTING.md` would provide the *exact commands* and *step-by-step processes*.

**3. Impact and Utility (Balancing Fragmentation vs. Over-Concentration):**

*   **For Humans:**
    *   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Separating these concerns makes information easier to find. A developer needing to know the PR process doesn't have to sift through architectural diagrams in `design-spec.md`.
    *   **Improved Onboarding:** New contributors can get up to speed much faster with a dedicated guide on how to set up and contribute.
    *   **Clarity:** `design-spec.md` remains focused on design, making it a clearer reference for architectural understanding.
    *   **Risk of Fragmentation:** Minimized by clear naming, well-defined scope for each document, and judicious cross-referencing. For example, `design-spec.md` might state the *policy* for dependency pinning, while `CONTRIBUTING.md` details the *commands* to update `requirements.txt` and `package-lock.json`.

*   **For Cascade (AI):**
    *   **Targeted Information Retrieval:** Cascade can be more efficiently directed. If asked to "create a new feature branch according to project standards," it would consult `CONTRIBUTING.md`. If asked "what are the security considerations for the auth module," it would consult `design/security-spec.md` and relevant parts of `design-spec.md`.
    *   **Reduced Ambiguity:** Prevents misinterpreting high-level design principles as immediate procedural instructions, or vice-versa.
    *   **Improved Task Execution:** Cascade can more accurately follow specific project workflows (e.g., commit message formatting, PR content generation) if they are clearly documented.
    *   **Avoiding Over-Concentration:** If `design-spec.md` became a monolithic document containing everything, it would be harder and slower for AI to parse and find the precise piece of information needed, potentially leading to less relevant or slower responses.

**Conclusion of Discussion:**
It was agreed that creating a `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`) is beneficial. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is more conventional and often recognized by platforms like GitHub. It provides a clear, focused home for practical, procedural information essential for day-to-day development, distinct from the architectural and strategic content of `design/design-spec.md`. This separation benefits both human developers (by improving clarity and ease of access) and AI assistants (by enabling more targeted and efficient information retrieval and task execution). The key is to ensure each document has a clear purpose and to cross-reference where appropriate.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-08 01:00 - Topic: Enhancing AI File Reading Guidance via Embedded Notes

**Objective:** To improve the reliability of AI analysis for lengthy and critical project documents by providing explicit, in-file guidance to AI assistants like Cascade.

**Problem Addressed:**
AI assistants, when processing large files, might sometimes rely on partial views (e.g., the first N lines or a specific section retrieved via a tool call) if not explicitly guided otherwise. For complex or critical documents where full context is paramount (like `design/security-spec.md`), this could lead to analyses or actions based on incomplete information, potentially missing crucial details or nuances.

**Solution Implemented (by USER):**
The USER added a new section titled "## AI Analysis Guidance for Cascade" at the beginning of `design/security-spec.md`. This section contains a direct instruction to Cascade:

```markdown
This file is over 200 lines long. Unless you are only looking for a specific section, you should read the entire file, which may require multiple tool calls.
```

**Rationale:**
This guidance is particularly important for documents like `design/security-spec.md`, which contains detailed security principles, best practices, and specific recommendations. By ensuring AI assistants read the entire file, we can avoid incomplete or potentially incorrect analyses based on partial views. This is especially critical for security documentation, where missing key details could lead to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**Future Considerations:**
*   We might consider adding similar guidance to other critical documents, such as `design/design-spec.md` or `design/ai-system-procedures.md`, to further enhance AI reliability.
*   It might be useful to create a template or guide for adding such AI guidance to critical documents, to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
