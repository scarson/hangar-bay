### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 04:46 - Topic: Enhancement of AISP-002 (AI-Assisted Session Summary Logging)

This session focused on significantly enhancing the AI-Assisted Session Summary Logging system, primarily documented in AISP-002. The key developments and decisions include:

1.  **Establishment of `design/cascade-log.md`:**
    *   A dedicated file, `design/cascade-log.md`, was created to store persistent, AI-generated summaries of interaction sessions.
    *   A consistent footer (`--- \n\n*(End of Cascade Interaction Log. New entries are appended above this line.)*`) was added to this file to ensure reliable and robust appending of new log entries.

2.  **Refinement of AISP-002 to Version 1.1:**
    *   The AI System Procedure `[AISP-002] AI-Assisted Session Summary Logging` (located in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`) was updated from its initial draft to version 1.1.
    *   **Proactive Logging Trigger:** The AI (Cascade) will now proactively identify suitable junctures (completion of non-trivial work like new file creation, significant edits, complex bug fixes, key design decisions) to propose logging a session summary to the USER, rather than solely relying on explicit USER commands.
    *   **Exclusion Criteria:** Trivial or routine actions (e.g., minor edits, simple Git operations, basic file views) are explicitly excluded from triggering logging proposals to avoid excessive noise.
    *   **Robust Append Strategy:** The procedure now specifies using the consistent footer in `design/cascade-log.md` as the target for appending new summaries, improving reliability.
    *   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for append failures was included, with instructions to notify the USER and provide fallback options.
    *   **Emphasis on Detail:** The procedure continues to emphasize the creation of verbose, rationale-focused summaries to maximize the contextual value of the logs.
    *   **AISP Reordering:** AISP-002 was correctly reordered within `design/ai-system-procedures.md` to maintain numerical sequence after AISP-001.

3.  **Update to Cascade's Operational Memory:**
    *   Cascade's internal operational memory (ID: `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`), which guides its execution of AISP-002, was updated to align precisely with the revised v1.1 procedure. This ensures the AI's behavior matches the documented standard.

4.  **Supporting Documentation Updates:**
    *   `design-log.md` was updated to reflect the initial creation of `cascade-log.md` and AISP-002.
    *   `starting-prompt.txt` was updated with USER feedback related to the logging system.

**Overall Goal:** These changes aim to create a more automated, reliable, and contextually rich system for logging significant AI-User interactions, making the `cascade-log.md` a valuable historical and contextual resource for the Hangar Bay project. The system balances AI proactivity with USER control.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 04:59 - Topic: In-depth Reproducibility Test of AISP-001 (Automated `feature-index.md` Maintenance)

This session segment featured a comprehensive test of the `[AISP-001] Automated Maintenance of feature-index.md` procedure, as documented in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`. The primary goal was to rigorously assess its reproducibility by simulating the creation of an operational AI memory based solely on the AISP-001 specification.

**Test Conception and Planning:**
*   **USER Rationale:** The USER proposed the test to evaluate if AISP-001's level of detail was sufficient for understanding and potential re-implementation, a key criterion for such documentation.
*   **Proposed Methodology:**
    1.  Cascade reads AISP-001.
    2.  Cascade creates a temporary operational memory based *only* on AISP-001.
    3.  Cascade compares this temporary memory to the original memory (ID: `8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6`) which informed AISP-001's creation.
    4.  Cascade identifies differences, analyzes their significance (considering the "right balance" of detail vs. over-scripting), and reports findings before any document changes.
*   **Cascade's Initial Assessment of the Test Idea:**
    *   **Effectiveness (Pros):** Deemed a valuable approach to directly probe if AISP-001 contained enough explicit information for an AI to reconstruct the intended logic and to identify potential gaps or ambiguities.
    *   **Challenges (Cons/Considerations):**
        *   **Context Window Bias (Significant Concern):** Cascade acknowledged a strong potential for bias, as it was directly involved in creating AISP-001 from the original memory. It was noted that a true de novo reproducibility test would require an AI instance with no prior project exposure. The test was thus framed as an assessment of AISP-001's internal consistency and clarity to an *already informed* agent.
        *   **Nature of Memory vs. Specification:** Differences in metadata (title, tags) and exact phrasing were expected, with the focus being on procedural logic equivalence.
*   **Agreed Test Plan:** A multi-phase plan was adopted: Setup (confirming understanding of bias, defining focus on procedural logic), Execution (reading AISP-001, formulating and creating temporary memory, referencing original memory), Analysis & Reporting (detailed comparison, critical evaluation, comprehensive report), and Cleanup (deleting temporary memory).

**Test Execution Details:**
1.  **Reading AISP-001:** Cascade reviewed the AISP-001 section in `design/ai-system-procedures.md`.
2.  **Temporary Memory Formulation:** Content for a new memory was synthesized strictly from AISP-001's text. Title: "Temp Memory from AISP-001 Test", Tags: ["test", "aisp_reproducibility"].
3.  **Temporary Memory Creation:** The temporary memory was created (ID: `588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2`).
4.  **Original Memory Reference:** The content of the original memory (`8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6`) was used for comparison.

**Detailed Analysis & Reporting - Key Comparison Points:**
*   **Overall Structure & Intent:** Both memories conveyed the same core procedure with largely identical steps.
*   **Introductory Sentences:** The temporary memory's intro (from AISP-001) included more of the "Problem Addressed," while the original was more direct about the index's mapping function. Deemed a minor difference in emphasis.
*   **Trigger Conditions:** Functionally identical; AISP-001 added minor stylistic clarifications.
*   **Action Steps - Enhancements in AISP-001:**
    *   **Explicit Tool Mentions:** AISP-001's inclusion of specific tool names (e.g., `view_file` for reading `feature-index.md` and feature specs, `find_by_name` for listing feature files) was a clear improvement over the original memory's implied tool usage. This was well-translated.
    *   **Separation of Approval Step:** AISP-001 correctly separated "7. Await USER approval before proceeding" from "8. Upon USER approval, use the `replace_file_content` tool," which was a more precise procedural representation than the original memory's combined step.
*   **Rationale Section Differences:**
    *   The temporary memory's rationale (from AISP-001's "Rationale & Design Philosophy") focused on the *design of the procedure* (AI-assisted, human-supervised, trigger-based).
    *   The original memory's rationale focused on the *benefits/outcomes* of the procedure (accurate map, improved AI performance, reduced ambiguity).
    *   This difference was considered acceptable as AISP-001 also contained a separate "Expected Outcome / Success Criteria" section that aligned with the original memory's rationale.
*   **No Major Gaps Identified:** No significant procedural steps or critical logic from the original memory were found to be missing or underivable from AISP-001.
*   **Evaluation of "Right Balance":** The level of detail in AISP-001's steps was assessed as achieving a good balance, specifying *what* to do and key tools/decisions without over-scripting AI thought processes (e.g., "Extract its Feature ID (e.g., F00X from F00X-SomeName.md)" is clear but not overly prescriptive on parsing).
*   **Influence of Context Bias:** Cascade acknowledged its existing context likely facilitated a close match, but the strong scaffolding provided by AISP-001's structure was deemed beneficial for any AI.

**Overall Assessment of AISP-001's Reproducibility:**
*   AISP-001 demonstrated a **high degree of reproducibility** for its core procedural logic.
*   The document was found to be well-structured and sufficiently detailed.

**Outcome & Action Taken:**
*   **Suggestion for AISP-001 Improvement:** Stemming from the "Rationale" section analysis, Cascade proposed a minor improvement: AISP-001's "Notes for Human Reviewers & Maintainers" section could suggest that when encoding the procedure into an AI's operational memory, the memory's "Rationale" should primarily emphasize the *benefits and expected outcomes* (drawing from AISP-001's "Expected Outcome / Success Criteria" section). This would ensure the AI's operational memory clearly links actions to their intended positive impact, while the AISP document itself details the procedure's design rationale.
*   **AISP-001 Update:** The USER concurred. Cascade updated Section 8 of AISP-001 in `design/ai-system-procedures.md` with this guidance: *"...When encoding this procedure into an AI's operational memory...consider structuring the memory's "Rationale"...to primarily emphasize the benefits and expected outcomes...This distinction helps ensure the AI's operational memory clearly links its actions to their intended positive impact."*
*   **Cleanup:** The temporary memory (`588904ad-da03-4fde-9e31-31361b6995e2`) was successfully deleted.

**Conclusion:** The in-depth test was a successful and valuable exercise. It validated the quality and reproducibility of the AISP-001 documentation and resulted in a practical refinement to guide future AI memory creation based on AISP specifications.

### Session Log: 2025-06-06

**AI Assistant:** Cascade
**User:** Sam
**Objective:** Systematically review and resolve open design points and ambiguities in feature specifications F004 through F007, update documentation, and incorporate user feedback for clarity.

**Summary of Activities & Resolutions:**

During this session, we completed the review and update of feature specifications F004, F005, F006, and F007, addressing all identified open design points and ambiguities. The "Last Updated" date for all modified documents was set to 2025-06-06.

1.  **F004 - User Authentication with EVE SSO (`design/features/F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md`)**
    *   **Token Refresh Scope (MVP):**
        *   Clarified that for MVP, token refresh will primarily be event-driven, occurring just before an ESI call is made on behalf of the user if the current access token is expired or near expiry. This approach avoids the complexity of a continuous background speculative refresh service for all users.
        *   **Detailed Discussion on F004 Token Refresh in Relation to F006/F007 Background ESI Calls:**
            *   The user raised a critical point about the Watchlist feature (F006) inherently requiring proactive background activity to be useful, questioning if F004's MVP token refresh strategy adequately supports this.
            *   **Resolution & Clarification:**
                1.  **F004's Core Philosophy:** The F004 MVP aims for an "on-demand" or "event-driven" token refresh. An "event" can be a direct user UI action or a scheduled background task (like for F007 alerts) that needs to make an ESI call using a specific user's token. F004 provides the *capability* (the logic and function) to refresh a token.
                2.  **Avoidance of Continuous Global Refresh:** F004 MVP deliberately avoids a separate, continuous background service that speculatively refreshes *all* user tokens *all the time*, irrespective of immediate need, to reduce initial complexity.
                3.  **F006/F007 MVP ESI Token Interaction:** For the current MVP scope, F007 (Alerts) uses F006 (Watchlists) and F001 (Public Contract Data). The background task for F007 compares user watchlist criteria against *locally stored public contract data from F001*. The process populating F001 typically uses an application-level ESI token or unauthenticated calls for public data, *not individual user access tokens*. Thus, the F006/F007 MVP background alerting task itself might not directly make ESI calls requiring individual user tokens.
                4.  **F004's Support for Background User-Specific ESI Calls:** F004's design *does account for and support* the scenario where background tasks might need to refresh user-specific tokens. If a background task (for F006/F007 or future features) *does* need to make an ESI call requiring a specific user's token (e.g., if watchlists were expanded to monitor private assets), that task would use the F004-provided mechanism: check token validity, refresh if needed.
                5.  **Conclusion:** F004 provides the *tool* for token refresh. Any system component (foreground UI-triggered or background task-triggered) needing to make a user-specific ESI call can and should use this tool. The F004 approach is adaptable for future features or expansions of F006/F007 that require background, user-specific ESI calls. The key is that the refresh is triggered by a need, not by continuous speculation.
    *   **Logout Behavior:** Confirmed that Hangar Bay logout invalidates the local application session only and does not revoke the EVE SSO refresh token at the identity provider, aligning with standard OAuth 2.0 practices.
    *   **ESI Scopes Requested:** A minimal base set of scopes (e.g., `publicData`) will be requested during initial authentication primarily for user identification. The application will store and operate based on the scopes actually granted by the user.
    *   **AI Checklist Items:** Updated relevant AI checklist items for EVE SSO OAuth endpoints to "Developer Action" with notes emphasizing these are developer verification steps against official documentation.

2.  **F005 - Saved Searches (`design/features/F005-Saved-Searches.md`)**
    *   **MVP Scope for Updates:** Resolved that for MVP, users can only rename and delete existing saved searches. Updating the underlying search criteria of a saved search is deferred to post-MVP.
    *   **Duplicate Saved Search Names:** Confirmed that duplicate saved search names per user will be prevented via a unique database constraint on `(user_id, name)`. The API will return a 409 Conflict status with a user-friendly error message.
    *   **AI Note on UI Mockups:** Added an AI note clarifying that UI mockups for saved search interactions are a design phase responsibility.

3.  **F006 - Watchlists (`design/features/F006-Watchlists.md`)**
    *   **Live Market Data Display:** Clarified that displaying live market data (e.g., current lowest price) directly in the watchlist view is out of scope for F006 itself. This functionality is primarily handled by F007 (Alerts/Notifications) which processes watchlist criteria against market data.
    *   **`notes` Field:** Confirmed the inclusion of an optional `notes` text field in the `watchlist_items` table for user annotations.
    *   **Duplicate Watchlist Items:** Confirmed a uniqueness constraint on `(user_id, type_id)` in the `watchlist_items` table to prevent duplicate entries for the same item type per user. API will respond with 409 Conflict.
    *   **AI Checklist Items:** Changed AI checklist items related to ESI universe type endpoints to "Developer Action" with explanatory notes for developer verification.
    *   **AI Note on UI Mockups:** Added an AI note that UI mockups for watchlist pages and interactions are a design phase responsibility.

4.  **F007 - Alerts and Notifications (`design/features/F007-Alerts-Notifications.md`)**
    *   **Email Notifications:** Deferred to post-MVP to reduce initial complexity. MVP will focus on in-app notifications.
    *   **Saved Search Alerts:** Deferred to post-MVP. MVP alerts will be based on watchlist criteria.
    *   **Notification De-duplication (MVP):** A notification is generated once for a unique `(user_id, contract_id, watchlist_item_id)` match. Re-notification for the same contract may occur if it's re-listed after a significant period or if its price drops further significantly below the user's `max_price`, subject to a cooldown (e.g., 24 hours).
    *   **Auction Notifications (MVP):** Notifications trigger if the current auction bid meets or is below the user's `max_price`. Further significant price drops can trigger new notifications per de-duplication rules.
    *   **Notification Content (MVP):** Messages will include item name, price found, location (if available), and a direct link to the contract.
    *   **Data Models:**
        *   `notifications` table: `type` field enum simplified to `'watchlist_match'`, `'system_message'`. 
        *   `user_notification_settings` table: Simplified to include `user_id`, `enable_watchlist_alerts` (default true), and `updated_at`. Fields for saved search alerts and email notifications removed for MVP.
    *   **API Endpoints:** `GET /api/v1/me/notification-settings` and `PUT /api/v1/me/notification-settings` updated to reflect the simplified `UserNotificationSettingDisplay` and `UserNotificationSettingUpdate` Pydantic models (only `enable_watchlist_alerts`).
    *   **Workflow:** Backend check frequency for watchlist alerts set to "e.g., every 15-30 minutes for MVP, configurable."
    *   **UI/UX:** Added standard AI note regarding design team responsibility for mockups.
    *   **Section 15 ("Notes / Open Questions"):** Retitled to "Design Clarifications and Resolutions." Content updated to reflect that previously open points (MVP notification channels, check frequency) are now resolved and other points are clarifications of MVP scope.

**User Feedback Incorporated:**
*   The detailed explanation regarding F004 token refresh strategy and its support for potential background ESI calls required by features like F006/F007 was explicitly requested for inclusion in this summary for future reference.

**Files Modified:**
*   `design/features/F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md`
*   `design/features/F005-Saved-Searches.md`
*   `design/features/F006-Watchlists.md`
*   `design/features/F007-Alerts-Notifications.md`

**Next Steps (per user request):**
*   Stage and prepare commits for all pending changes.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 05:40 - Topic: Refinement of AISP-002 Logging Procedure to Prevent Separator Issues

**Objective:** To diagnose and resolve a recurring formatting issue in `design/cascade-log.md` related to duplicate Markdown separators (`---`) and to update the guiding AI System Procedure (AISP-002) to prevent future occurrences.

**Background:**
Following the previous session where feature specifications F004-F007 were updated and a summary was logged to `design/cascade-log.md`, a formatting error was observed: an extra `---` separator appeared between the newly appended log entry and the standard log footer.

**Diagnosis and Iterative Correction of `cascade-log.md`:**
1.  **Initial Problem:** The `cascade-log.md` file showed the pattern: `[Previous Log Content]\n\n---\n\n---\n\n*(End of Cascade Interaction Log...)*`.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   Cascade's drafted session summary (the content for "[Previous Log Content]") had inadvertently included a `---` at its very end.
    *   The AISP-002 procedure for appending logs (Step 9) correctly specifies that the `ReplacementContent` should be `\n\n---\n\n[NEW SUMMARY CONTENT]\n\n---\n\n*(Footer)*`. This means the append logic itself introduces a `---` separator before the new content and another one after it (which becomes the new separator before the footer).
    *   When the `[NEW SUMMARY CONTENT]` also ended with `---`, the sequence became `...summary_text---\n\n---\n\n*(Footer)*`, leading to the double separator.
3.  **Correction Attempts:**
    *   An initial `replace_file_content` attempt by Cascade to fix the `cascade-log.md` file was not perfectly accurate due to slight mismatches in the `TargetContent` argument, a common challenge when dealing with exact string replacements involving newlines and whitespace.
    *   Cascade used the `view_file` tool multiple times to inspect the precise problematic lines in `cascade-log.md`, ensuring the `TargetContent` for subsequent `replace_file_content` calls was an exact match of the erroneous section.
    *   After a few iterations, the `cascade-log.md` file was successfully corrected to the proper format: `[Log Content]\n\n---\n\n*(Footer)*`.

**Proactive Refinement of AISP-002:**
1.  **User Prompt for Reflection:** The USER astutely asked if AISP-002 itself needed an update to prevent this issue in the future.
2.  **Cascade's Analysis:**
    *   Cascade reviewed its internal instructions for AISP-002 (Memory ID `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`).
    *   It was determined that Step 6 ("Draft Summary") was the most appropriate place to introduce a preventative measure. The existing instruction was: "Compose a verbose, detailed Markdown summary... Structure logically, emphasizing 'why' and 'how.'"
3.  **Proposed Solution for AISP-002:**
    *   Cascade proposed modifying Step 6 to include an explicit instruction: "**Important: Ensure the drafted summary content itself does not end with a `---` Markdown horizontal rule, as the appending process (Step 9) will correctly add the necessary separator.**"
4.  **Implementation of AISP-002 Update:**
    *   The USER approved the proposed change.
    *   Cascade executed a `create_memory` tool call with `Action: "update"` to modify Memory ID `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf`. The entire content of the memory was re-submitted with the updated Step 6.

**Outcome:**
*   The `cascade-log.md` file's formatting has been corrected.
*   The AISP-002 procedure within Cascade's operational memory has been enhanced to prevent the AI from drafting summaries that would lead to future separator duplication, making the logging process more robust.

**Files Modified:**
*   `design/cascade-log.md` (corrected formatting and new log entry added)
*   Memory `42c9fb61-0933-428f-ad56-16e1f846afcf` (AISP-002 updated)

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 06:09 - Topic: F001 Spec Refinement

This session focused on the detailed review and refinement of the feature specification `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` to ensure its readiness for MVP development.

**Key Activities and Decisions:**

1.  **Initial Review:** `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` was reviewed to identify areas requiring clarification or further detail, aiming to align its quality with more recently updated specifications (F004-F007).
2.  **Identified Refinement Areas:** Several placeholders (e.g., `[NEEDS_DISCUSSION]`, `[NEEDS_DECISION]`) and areas for improvement were identified, including:
    *   Precise logic for identifying a "ship contract."
    *   Clarifications for data model fields (`contracts.start_location_name`, `contracts.volume`, `contract_items.record_id`).
    *   Definition of data model relationships and an initial indexing strategy.
    *   Specification of an ESI API error retry strategy.
    *   Definition of Hangar Bay API error response structures.
    *   Setting data freshness targets and incorporating a USER-requested feature for admin-triggered manual data refreshes.
    *   Strategy for handling contracts with numerous items.
    *   Clarifying database write strategies (individual vs. batch).
    *   Refining user story scope and updating acceptance criteria accordingly.
3.  **Discussion and Confirmation:** Proposed refinements for each identified area were presented to the USER. The USER provided feedback, notably requesting the inclusion of an admin-triggered manual data refresh capability, which was incorporated. All proposed changes were subsequently confirmed.
4.  **Document Update:** `F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` was updated by applying all agreed-upon changes to resolve ambiguities and enhance the specification's completeness.

This process has significantly improved the clarity and detail of F001, making it a more robust guide for development.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 06:15 - Topic: F002 Spec Refinement

This session focused on the detailed review and refinement of the feature specification `F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md`.

**Key Activities and Decisions:**

1.  **Initial Review:** `F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` was reviewed to identify areas for clarification, enhancement, and alignment with MVP goals.
2.  **Identified Refinement Areas:** Several areas were targeted for improvement:
    *   **User Stories:** Re-numbered existing stories to resolve duplicates. Added new user stories for filtering by broad ship categories and for indicating/filtering contracts with additional non-ship items.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Clarified criteria for information displayed in the list view (Story 1). Specified fields for keyword search (Story 2). Added new, detailed criteria for the new user stories related to ship category filtering and additional item indicators/filters.
    *   **Scope (In Scope):** Expanded to include filtering by broad ship categories and handling of additional item indicators/filters.
    *   **API Endpoints:** 
        *   Extended query parameters for `GET /api/v1/contracts/ships` to include `ship_market_group_id` and `contains_additional_items`.
        *   Added a new endpoint `GET /api/v1/ships/market_groups` to provide filterable ship categories to the UI.
    *   **UI/UX Considerations:** Added notes for visual indicators for additional items and specific filter controls for ship categories and additional items.
    *   **Notes / Open Questions (Section 15):** Updated to reflect that ship category filtering and additional item indicators/filters are now part of the MVP scope, moving details into core sections.
3.  **Discussion and Confirmation:** All proposed refinements were presented to and confirmed by the USER.
4.  **Document Update:** `F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` was updated by applying all agreed-upon changes, enhancing its clarity, detail, and readiness for MVP development.

This process has made F002 a more comprehensive and robust guide for development, particularly for user-facing search and filtering capabilities.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 06:24 - Topic: F003 Spec Refinement

This session focused on the detailed review and refinement of the feature specification `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md`.

**Key Activities and Decisions:**

1.  **Initial Review:** `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md` was reviewed to identify areas for clarification and enhancement, ensuring alignment with other refined MVP features.
2.  **Identified Refinement Areas:** Minor refinements were proposed and accepted:
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Clarified Criterion 2.1 regarding the display of ship attributes by referencing Section 15's logic. Updated Criterion 3.1 to specify the source of `current_bid`. Added a new criterion for displaying 'Additional Included Items' based on the `contracts.contains_additional_items` flag and details from `contract_items`.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Ensured the `Success_Response_Schema_Ref` for `GET /api/v1/contracts/ships/{contract_id}` explicitly includes the `contains_additional_items` flag from the `contracts` table and covers all items (ship and non-ship).
    *   **UI/UX Considerations:** Added a point about clearly displaying 'Additional Included Items' in a distinct section.
    *   **Notes / Open Questions (Section 15):** Updated the note on 'Handling Multiple Items in a "Ship Contract"' to confirm that F003 will use the `contracts.contains_additional_items` flag already established in F001.
3.  **Discussion and Confirmation:** All proposed refinements were presented to and confirmed by the USER.
4.  **Document Update:** `F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md` was updated by applying all agreed-upon changes, improving its precision for development.

This review completes the initial detailed refinement pass for the core MVP features F001, F002, and F003.


### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F007-Alerts-Notifications.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F007 (Alerts/Notifications) to ensure clarity, completeness, and alignment with MVP scope.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **Notification Message Content:** Enhanced to include the contract type (e.g., "Auction", "ItemExchange") in addition to item name, price, and location. Example: 'Caracal (Auction) found for 10,500,000 ISK in Jita. View contract.'
*   **Data Model (`notifications` table):** The example for `message_params` was updated to include `contract_type` (e.g., `{ship_name: 'Caracal', price: '1000000 ISK', location: 'Jita', contract_type: 'Auction'}`) to support the enhanced message content.
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Criterion 1.2):** Clarified that the `max_price` for watchlist alerts is sourced from the user's setting on the specific watchlist item.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F006-Watchlists.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F006 (Watchlists).

**Key Refinements:**
*   **Data Model (`watchlist_items` table):** Clarified in the `AI_Action_Focus` for the `type_id` field that validation should confirm it is a valid, published **ship** type ID, typically by checking against the `esi_type_cache` for appropriate category/group ID. This ensures watchlists are focused on shiptypes for MVP.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

---

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F005-Saved-Searches.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F005 (Saved Searches), resolving open questions.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **MVP Scope:** Confirmed that for MVP, updating the underlying search criteria of an existing saved search is deferred. MVP supports creating, renaming, executing, and deleting saved searches.
*   **Open Questions Resolved (Notes Section Updated):**
    *   **Long Saved Search Names:** UI will likely use truncation with tooltips for display.
    *   **Limit on Saved Searches:** No hard limit per user for MVP.
    *   **Invalid Filter Options:** If a saved search contains filter options that become invalid over time (e.g., due to game updates), these will be silently ignored when the search is applied, rather than causing an error.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.

### Session Summary - 2025-06-06 - Topic: Refinement of F004-User-Authentication-SSO.md

**Objective:** Review and refine the feature specification for F004 (User Authentication - EVE SSO), clarifying several key aspects of the authentication flow and token management.

**Key Refinements:**
*   **ESI Scopes & Token Validation:** Clarified that no ESI scopes are requested during the authentication itself for F004's core purpose. User identification is derived from validating the ID token JWT locally using EVE SSO's JWKS URI. The ESI `/oauth/verify` endpoint is an optional secondary verification.
*   **Refresh Token Failure:** If a refresh token fails, the Hangar Bay session will be invalidated, tokens cleared, and the user prompted to re-login with a clear message.
*   **Session Duration:** Hangar Bay sessions will have a longer lifespan (e.g., 7 days), managed by secure, HTTPOnly cookies.
*   **Character Transfer Handling:** The `CharacterOwnerHash` will be stored and verified on each login. If a mismatch occurs (indicating a potential character transfer), existing user records will be updated or handled according to a defined policy to maintain data integrity.
*   **Open Redirect Prevention:** The `/auth/sso/login` endpoint will validate the optional `next` URL parameter to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
*   **Status:** Marked as "Refined" in `feature-index.md`.
