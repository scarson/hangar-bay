# Hangar Bay - Observability Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the observability strategy for the Hangar Bay application. Comprehensive observability is crucial for understanding application behavior, diagnosing issues, monitoring performance, and ensuring reliability. It complements the security-focused logging detailed in `security-spec.md`.

## 2. Pillars of Observability

### 2.1. Logging
*   **Structured Logging:** All application logs (backend and frontend) MUST be structured (e.g., JSON format).
    *   **Benefits:** Easier parsing, searching, and analysis by log management systems.
*   **Log Levels:** Implement standard log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
    *   Allow configurable log levels per environment.
*   **Correlation IDs:** Generate/propagate a correlation ID for each incoming request (or initiated task) across all services and log messages related to that request/task. This is vital for tracing distributed operations.
*   **Key Information to Log:** Timestamp, log level, service name, correlation ID, message, and relevant context (e.g., endpoint, user ID if authenticated, ESI request details - sanitizing sensitive info).
*   **Security:** Sensitive data (passwords, raw ESI tokens) MUST NOT be logged. Refer to `security-spec.md`.

### 2.2. Metrics
*   **Application Metrics (Backend - FastAPI):**
    *   Request rate, error rate, latency (overall and per-endpoint).
    *   ESI API interaction metrics: call count, error rate, latency per ESI endpoint.
    *   Database query performance: execution time, error rate per query type.
    *   Cache performance: hit/miss ratio, latency.
    *   Task queue metrics (for alerts): queue length, task processing time, error rate.
*   **Frontend Metrics (Angular):**
    *   Page load times, component interaction times.
    *   Client-side error rates.
    *   API call latency from client perspective.
*   **System Metrics:** CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic for application hosts/containers.
*   **Business Metrics (High-Level):**
    *   Number of active users (if SSO implemented).
    *   Number of contracts processed/displayed.
    *   Watchlist creation/alert triggering frequency.

### 2.3. Tracing (Distributed Tracing)
*   **Goal:** To visualize the entire lifecycle of a request as it flows through different components of the application (e.g., frontend -> backend API -> ESI API -> database -> cache).
*   **Implementation:** Utilize OpenTelemetry (or similar) compatible libraries to instrument code and propagate trace context.
*   **Benefits:** Pinpoint bottlenecks, understand service dependencies, debug complex issues in a distributed environment.

### 2.4. Error Tracking & Alerting (Operational)
*   **Centralized Error Aggregation:** Collect and aggregate exceptions and errors from both backend and frontend in a centralized system.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical errors, unusual spikes in error rates, performance degradation, or system resource exhaustion.
    *   Distinguish from user-facing application alerts (e.g., new contract found).

## 3. Tools and Technologies (Proposed)

*   **Logging Management:**
    *   *(Placeholder: e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; Grafana Loki; or cloud provider solutions like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging)*
*   **Metrics Collection & Visualization:**
    *   **Backend:** Prometheus client libraries for FastAPI.
    *   **System:** Prometheus Node Exporter or similar.
    *   **Storage & Visualization:** Prometheus (time-series database) & Grafana (dashboards).
*   **Distributed Tracing:**
    *   **Instrumentation:** OpenTelemetry SDKs for Python and JavaScript.
    *   **Backend Collector/Storage:** *(Placeholder: e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, or OpenTelemetry Collector with a compatible backend)*
*   **Error Tracking:**
    *   *(Placeholder: e.g., Sentry, Rollbar, Elastic APM, or cloud provider solutions)*

## 4. Observability by Design

*   Instrumentation for logging, metrics, and tracing should be considered during development, not as an afterthought.
*   Dashboards should be created to visualize key metrics and logs for different components and user flows.

## 5. CI/CD Integration

*   Ensure that observability configurations and instrumentation are part of the deployment pipeline.
