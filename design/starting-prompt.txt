# Windsurf Editor using Gemini 2.5 Pro

Hello, I have an idea for an ecommerce site (the "application" or "app") for selling ships in the video game EVE Online. It will be called "Hanger Bay", which is also the name of this project. I would like your assistance in creating a design specification ("design spec") for the application. The design spec should be structured to be a highly effective input into Windsurf / Cascade to use to write the application code once it's complete. We will work through aspects of the application architecture and design together. I have a some programming and software architecture experience and can make decisions if provided with high quality information to inform them. However, do not be hesitant to have strong opinions in design areas if they can be justified. I have not decided on any specific tech stack for this app. I pre-created an empty design spec markdown file for us to use, which can be found at path "C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\design-spec.txt"

Before doing anything else, create a memory emphasizing that SECURITY IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT for this application. EVE Online players, the target audience for Hangar Bay, are known for their ingenuity in exploiting systems. Theft, deceit, extortion, hacking, and scheming are considered legitimate parts of the EVE Online metagame.. This app will be targeted. Parties with malicious intent will try to exploit the app in every possible way. WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN. There must be NO tradeoffs where security is sacrificed for features or convenience. Security must be an overriding concern in every applicable design and implementation area. AT ABSOLUTE MINIMUM, THE APPLICATION MUST TAKE EXTREME PRECAUTIONS AGAINST (1) ALL OWASP TOP 10 WEB APPLICATION SECURITY RISKS AND (2) USE LEADING/BEST SECURE CODING PRACTICES FOR ALL LANGUAGES, FRAMEWORKS, AND TECHOLOGIES USED IN THE APP. Proactively think through potential attack vectors and risks for the application and aggressively eliminate them by design or implement effective mitigations wherever possible. Where attack vectors and risks cannot be effectively eliminated by design or mitigated, extensively think through possible alternatives, and if no alternatives are feasible, document the risk as clearly as possible. The design spec should have a Security section, and all other sections must include a reference to the Security section with instructions to consider it part of their spec too.

We will start the process by having you learn about EVE so we can have a more informed design dialog afterward.

First, review these links to learn about EVE in general:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online
* https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon - this will teach you EVE terminology you might find in subsequent articles
* https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Getting_Started_in_EVE_Online
* https://www.eveonline.com/eve-academy

Then, review these articles about the modern EVE API called "ESI" that we will use to get ship pricing and other such market information from the game:
* https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/eve-evolved-the-future-of-eves-api
* https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/introducing-esi
* https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/introducing-the-esi-api
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/overview/ - official developer documentation landing page
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/best-practices/ - official developer documentation - best practices
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/sso/ - official developer documentation - single sign-on guidance
* https://esi.evetech.net/ui/ - ESI API Swagger UI / OpenAPI spec

There is a 3rd party site that has some of the fuctionality we're interested in called EVE Market Browser. You can review it here:
* https://evemarketbrowser.com/region/

After reviewing all this, think about if there's any additional information you might want before starting our design discussion and bring it up if so. 


----------------


1. You raise great points with "User Authentication (EVE SSO): While not strictly required for users to browse public contracts (which are, by definition, public), EVE SSO could still be valuable for:
* Allowing users to save searches or create watchlists for specific ships or contract types.
* Potentially allowing users to see their own public contracts highlighted if they choose to log in.
* We can consider SSO an optional feature for enhanced user experience, rather than a core requirement for the MVP."

I think allowing users to save searches and create watchlists for specific ships or contract types would be a core value-add feature of the app, so let's make this a requirement. With regards to watchlists, users should be able to set up alerts to be notified when configurable watchlist criteria are met (for example, a contract for a desired ship is available below a specified price threshold).

2. Backend framework: I would like to consider Python vs Go in more depth. My high-level understanding of Go is that it's designed for high performance, API-driven web applications and has highly opinionated security defaults. I have a little familiarity with Python from years ago but am most experienced with C#. That doesn't mean I want to use a .NET stack. Rather, I'm interested in how my C# / .NET experience might translate to Python or Go.

3. Database: For the purposes of rapid prototyping and keeping things more self-contained, I'm interested in using SQLite during development. If we did that, how much risk and complexity would likely be involved in switching over to PostgreSQL later on?

4. Caching layer: Redis recently had a major open source fork called Valkey. While largely the same code, they have now diversed somewhat in features. Please perform an assessment of the latest available versions of Redis (8.0.2) and Valkey (8.1.1) in the context of which may be better suited for this project. If there are no applicable functional differences, prefer Valkey. Here are some resources I found on the internet that might serve as starting points for your research:
* https://redis.io/blog/what-is-valkey/ 
* https://betterstack.com/community/comparisons/redis-vs-valkey/
* https://www.dragonflydb.io/blog/redis-8-0-vs-valkey-8-1-a-technical-comparison
* https://dimasyotama.medium.com/valkey-vs-redis-the-fork-awakens-understanding-the-split-key-differences-and-implementation-89c0123403eb
* https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/what-is-valkey/
* https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey
* https://valkey.io/topics/

5. Frontend framework: Consider Angular as another alternative as I have an interest in learning it. What are the pros and cons vs React and Vue.js?

6. Deployment: I agree the app must be able to be containerized for deployment. This should be done in way agnostic to hosting provider like AWS or Azure to keep our options open. Let's make sure this is an explicit requirement in the design spec.

7. Because security is paramount and there will be many security-related details that are too specific for the more general principles in the design spec, I've created a separate markdown file called "C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\design\security-spec.md". We'll call this the "security spec". Use this file to document important security considerations that are more detailed than appropriate for the design spec. For example, specific guideslines for Flask or other technologies, DoS prevention techniques relevant to the app, standards for secure handling of auth tokens and secrets, etc. UPDATE AND REFERENCE THIS FILE AS NEEDED TO HELP FULFILL THE SECURITY OBJECTIVES.

Start by populating the security spec with information that is or will likely be relevant to the app. All data must be encrypted in transit with TLS 1.2 or 1.3, using only cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy. If there are opportunities to use NIST-approved quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, we should do so unless there are significant downsides. After making those updates, update your SECURITY IS PARAMOUNT memory to include the security spec file.


---------------


1. User Authentication (EVE SSO), Watchlists, and Alerts:
Great. Please think about other high value-add features the app could potentially have now that EVE SSO is a foundational requirement. Try to identify low hanging fruit - features that could add meaningful value for users without significant scope creep or increases in implementation complexity, staying within the ship-centric focus of Hangar Bay. Eve Market Browser already exists and it'd be good to have some competitive differentiators. 

2. Backend Framework: Python (FastAPI) vs. Go
I'm sold on starting with Python/FastAPI. Let's tentatively spec it for now.

2.1 I see you've specified Uvicorn as the ASGI server for FastAPI. I skimmed this article, which mentions a key takeaway of "ASGI Servers: Choose the right ASGI server (Uvicorn, Hypercorn, or Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers) based on your specific needs.":
https://medium.com/@ramanbazhanau/preparing-fastapi-for-production-a-comprehensive-guide-d167e693aa2b (if you cannot read the full article online due the Medium paywall, let me know and I will save it as a PDF and provide the file)
What might we consider about other ASGI server options before solidifying this decision?

3. Database: SQLite for Development, PostgreSQL for Production
I like the proposed ORM approach. Let's make sure to use an ORM and design our schemas and queries with PostgreSQL capabilities in mind. Add this to the design spec. We will not need to actually migrate data from SQLite to PostgreSQL. We'll deploy the schema and populate it with fresh data from appropriate sources. 

4. Caching Layer: Redis vs. Valkey
Thanks for the assessment. Let's spec Valkey based on your findings.

5. Frontend Framework: Angular vs. React vs. Vue.js
Let's go with Angular. While the simplicity of Vue.js is appealing, I like TypeScript's static typing (which I think can help us avoid type errors that could impact security) and there is significant value to me in learning Angular better.

7. I agree with your assessment of the current state of PQC. Let's keep that aspirational as you've indicated in the security spec. However, please add an encryption at rest subsection of Cryptography. We should make sure to encrypt sensitive data at rest and consider approaches for this, which may be different for various parts of the app. Note that the best thing for data security is to not store sensitive data you don't need to hold onto in the first place, as you can't lose what you don't have. We should not retain any more data than is necessary to provide application functions.

8. In the database response, you mentioned a test suite. A robust test strategy and suite is very important. Let's make sure we're adding methodical, useful test coverage from the beginning. Please create a test-spec.md file (the "test spec") alongside the security and design specs and populate it with relevant information so far. Add placeholders where appropriate to update later once relevant details are known.

9. We're starting to make a lot of design decisions. I saw you mentioned some Reasoning and Alternatives Considered points in the design spec, which is fantastic, but I'd also like to keep a separate chronological record of major design discussion points, considerations, and decisions made. Let's call this the "design decision log", or "design log" for short. Please create design-log.md in the same directory as the design spec. Update it with all the major design discussion points, considerations, and decisions made so far, in generally chronological order. Ultimately, a person should be able to read it and come away with the "story" of how this design process developed. After populating the initial design log, create a memory for it, and continue to update the design log throughout the project whenever appropriate.

10. The Preparing FastAPI for Production: A Comprehensive Guide also lists as a key point: "Logging and Monitoring: Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring to gain insights into your application’s behavior and quickly identify issues."
Because we are security focused and as a matter of general good practice, let's make sure that we build in observability with logging and monitoring from the beginning. This should apply to the application as a whole, not just FastAPI. Please create a observability-spec.md file ("observ spec" for short) in the same directory as the design spec. This observ spec is focused primarily on observability, rather than the Security event logging, audit trails, intrusion detection/prevention in the Logging and Monitoring section of the security spec. Populate it with relevant information so far. Add placeholders where appropriate to update later once relevant details are known. Then update the design spec to include references to the logging spec wherever appropriate. However, if you think this is extraneous and has too much overlap with the design and security specs, please raise that concern so we can discuss the best way to ensure observability considerations are addressed throughout the project. 

Let's address the items above before proceeding with detailing some of the other sections in the design and security specs.


---------------


1. I realize I'd intended to have the design spec be a markdown file like the others, but accidentally specified a .txt extension. Please copy its contents to a new design-spec.md file, apply markdown formatting like the other specs docs, verify that all the content is the same aside from the markdown formatting, then delete the design-spec.txt file. Then update any relevant memories to reference the new design-spec.md file instead of the old design-spec.txt.

2. In the design log, please add a timestamp to each section block based on your knowledge of the system timestamps for your own responses. Record the datetimes in ISO 8601 format with the U.S. Central time zone. Update the "*(This log will be updated as more decisions are made.)*" note with an instruction to yourself to include these timestamps going forward.

3. In the design spec, make a note in an appropriate location to further detail user notification mechanisms for watchlist and other alerts. We will presumably need an SMTP email integration of some sort. However, it would also be interesting to know if the ESI API provides any methods to send in-game notifications to players.

4. As these individual feature areas get more implementation details, we may want to capture those in individual feature spec markdown files to facilitate Windsurf using them as references when writing and reviewing the related code. We could create a "features" directory within the existing "design" project directory to organize and store these files. What do you think of this approach? How could it be improved to better facilitate effective use of the Windsurf (with Gemini Pro 2.5) coding assistant? I'm very open to other ideas, so if you have any that could help accomplish this objective, please propose them.


---------------


1. In the design log, the timestamps are in the format "2025-06-04T23:00:00-05:00". For easier reading, please remove the "T" that appears before the time section and replace it with a space. Update the instruction at the end of the document to reflect this updated timestamp format.

2. I love your feedback on the feature spec details. Let's start by creating a template feature spec that contains those key elements that make them useful to AI coding assistants and beyond. Please first create the "features" directory, then create a "00-feature-spec-template.md" markdown file (we'll refer to it as the "feature spec template") and populate it with all the sections you proposed. Try to think of others that might be helpful as well. It's okay if some are only conditionally applicable, like API Endpoints Involved. Mark each section as Required or Optional. Make sure the feature spec template includes an instruction to always include Required sections, and evaluate each Optional section for applicability. When we create a new feature spec, start by looking at the feature spec template, assessing each Optional section for applicability, and then copying over all the Required and applicable Optional sections. If you have any enhancements to that procedure that could make the process more effective please propose them. Then, create a memory for feature creation that captures this feature spec template reference, assessment, and copying process.


---------------


1. Please update the design log with our approach for feature spec management.

2. For the observability spec, let's prefer OpenTelemetry compatible options wherever possible. Update the spec as appropriate.

3. I want you to review the design spec, identify features that should have their own feature spec, then create initial feature specs for each one with the information we have available so far. As we're still in the design stage, when you create these feature specs, explicitly note where additional information, discussion, and/or decision points are required in each feature spec section. 

4. After creating the initial feature specs, we should prioritize which to work on first. One idea for this is to see which feature or features are common dependencies for others. That might suggest we should work on them first, since their details may have downstream impacts on other features that depend on them. However, there may be other good ways to prioritize what to work on first and I'm very open to any alternative ideas you have.


---------------


Let's go through some of the [NEEDS_DISCUSSION] / [NEEDS_DECISION] items, by feature, starting with F001.

F001:
5. Key Data Structures / Models: 
* For "issuer_name", store the name. Changing character names is an uncommon and difficult task in EVE that requires opening a formal support request. For this reason, there's likely little value in making an extra call to resolve the name on display. 
* For "start_location_name", resolve on display.
* I am still unsure about "volume"
* For the esi_type_cache table, we should store all dogma_attribute and dogma_effects. We don't know which might be relevant to users, this isn't sensitive information so there isn't a security issue storing it, and there are a relatively small number of ships to store data for in the context of a modern database. However, I do see this is a JSONB type. Does SQLite support JSONB?

9. Error Handling & Edge Cases (Required)
* For "[NEEDS_DISCUSSION: Retry strategy for DB errors]" - Please research common database retry strategies that are applicable to PostgreSQL, since we'll be using that for Production. Then add details for the strategies that seem appropriate for Hanger Bay's architecture.
* For "[FURTHER_DETAIL_REQUIRED: More specific edge cases related to contract types (auction vs. item_exchange), item types, etc.]" - we'll deal with these later when we understand the contract types better.

13. Notes / Open Questions
* For "[NEEDS_DECISION: Which EVE regions to poll by default? Should this be configurable by an admin?]" this should be configurable. For prototyping we'll likely want to set that configuration to only one or two regions but it's important that region selection by admins is flexible.
* For "[NEEDS_DISCUSSION: How to handle updates to existing contracts if ESI data changes before expiration (e.g., auction price changes)? Re-fetch items and update, or rely on full periodic re-scans?]" - Full scans sound expensive. However, with the re-fetch and update approach, how would we know when to update?

Please discuss and update the feature spec accordingly.


---------------


F002:
2. User Stories
* [FURTHER_DETAIL_REQUIRED: User story for viewing basic contract details in the list view.] - What details are required to write this user story? Start by checking Check EVE Market Browser (https://evemarketbrowser.com/region/), assessing the basic contract details it shows in its list view, and using those as our default set. That's a popular service with players and presumably provides a good starting point for what fields are useful.

13. Notes / Open Questions
* [NEEDS_DECISION: Specific fields to include in the list view for each contract.] - Let's use the fields from the ship page(s) of EVE Market Browser as our starting point. 
* [NEEDS_DECISION: Default sort order.] - Check EVE Market Browser for its default sort order as well. We'll start with that.
* [NEEDS_DISCUSSION: How to handle filtering by ship attributes (e.g., meta level, tech level) if desired in the future? Requires more detailed `esi_type_cache` and backend logic.] - This more advanced filtering would be good to have the capabilities for. Please expand on the more detailed esi_type_cashe and backend logic that might be required to support this.
* [NEEDS_DISCUSSION: Exact list of filterable ship categories/groups. Should this be dynamic based on available data or a fixed list?] - Check the EVE Market Browser implementation and see if their approach can be determined. If not, is the list of ships available through the ESI API? If it's available through the API, as ship categories probably don't change very often, we could probably do something like poll ESI for the list once per hour or day and cache the response in a fixed list to use with the site. That would dramatically reduce the number of calls required to maintain the list while still keeping it reasonably fresh.


---------------


Let's move to F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md

First, assess if there is anything we can initially update in F003 based on our updates to F001 and F002. Then proceed with acting on this feedback:

F003:
13. Notes / Open Questions
* [NEEDS_RESEARCH: How to best display ship attributes from `dogma_attributes`? Select key ones or show all? Formatting?] - Is there anything you can tell from EMB to help inform this? If you can't, because UI space is limited, let's take the approach of displaying some key ones with some method of expanding the display to show more or all.
* [NEEDS_DECISION: If a contract contains multiple items (e.g., a ship and some modules), how are non-ship items displayed, if at all, on this *ship* contract view? Current assumption is F001 filters for *primarily* ship contracts.] - Let's take the approach of flagging these "mixed" contracts with a boolean property if we're not already. This would enable setting an indicator for when other items are in the contract. If it's easy to list the names and quantities of those non-ship items, we should do so. However, I think we should avoid trying to display more properties than name and quantity because that could very quickly increase the complexity and ESI API surface and data schema we need to deal with. That said, there may be some specific item categories that are frequently paired with ships, like Modules, it would be useful to have handling for because users might value that information. 
* [NEEDS_RESEARCH: Availability and usage of EVE Online's image server for ship renders (e.g., `https://images.evetech.net/types/{type_id}/render?size=512`).] - Please provide guidance on the research task(s) to move this item forward, conduct them yourself if possible, and then update the item.

After addressing the F003 items, please assess if there is anything we should go back and update in F001 and F003 given these decisions in F003.


---------------


It occurred to me that many potential users might want to access the Hanger Bay site on their phones. While modern web frameworks are generally device responsive, we should explicitly include "Mobile friendly design" in the main design-spec.md. Think about how best to structure the "mobile friendly design" entry in the context of being useful to an AI coding assistant, then update design-spec.md with it in an appropriate location. Then, update test-spec.md to include mentions of testing for different display formats (e.g., desktop vs mobile) in an appropriate location.


---------------


I'm glad you mentioned accessibility and I see the "**Accessibility (A11y):** All accessibility principles (WCAG AA as a minimum target) apply equally to mobile views. Ensure ARIA attributes are used correctly for dynamic content and custom controls." item in the "Mobile-Friendly and Responsive Design (Core Requirement)" section of design-spec.md. This is the first explicit mention of accessibility principles I've seen. Accessibility is critically important in software design and genuinely makes the world a kinder, more welcoming place for everyone. This should be captured in a new \design\accessibility-spec.md file. The accessibility spec should be structured in the context of being useful to an AI coding assistant ensuring accessibility requirements are always met while developing the application. The spec should state WCAG AA as a minimum target, and include sections relevant to any technologies used in the application's tech stack, with a focus on frontend technologies. Please include any other modern accessibility principles that could apply to Hanger Bay. 

Then, update design-spec.md to incorporate accessibility-spec.md by reference in any applicable sections, just like with security-spec.md.

Then, update test-spec.md to incorporate accessibility testing in any applicable sections.

Then, update the design-log with a new entry about the mobile friendly design and accessiblity updates.

Then, stage and prepare git commits for design-log.md, design-spec.md, test-spec.md, and accessibility-spec.md.


---------------


Before we proceed, please review all current spec files (which is all files except design-log.md) for potential enhancements in the context of making them more useful to an AI coding assistant. Propose any enhancements, describing in detail why you think they could make the specs more effective for an AI coding assistant. design-spec.md still has an important role for human reviewer understanding the project, so take special care to preserve human readability for the design spec. 

Then, for any changes you are confident will make the specs more useful to an AI coding assistant, implement the changes. 

Then, update design-log.md with a new entry describing the changes.


----------------


I have reviewed the changes. Very impressive! I have a single feedback point.

In security-spec.md 1.1 Encryption in Transit, please update the new "Ensure backend to PostgreSQL calls use TLS if over a non-trusted network." item to "Ensure backend to PostgreSQL calls use TLS". We should encrypt all data in transit. Network boundaries do not provide security guarantees and we should follow the modern security practice of an "assume breach" threat posture and zero-trust principles. These principles have broader importance beyond just PostgreSQL encryption in transit. Please also add references to zero-trust principles in an appropriate location or locations within security-spec.md.

After updating security-spec.md, please prepare git commits for all the changed files with that good commit message.


----------------


Before we move onto coding, we have four more features, F004, F005, F006, and F007 to review. We should do that next. Before we proceed, please update all relevant project memories.


----------------


I am greatly enjoying our collaboration on this project so far and feel it has been mutually beneficial. I would like you to perform a comprehensive, honest assessment of all the feedback I've provided so far. As part of this, please provide an honest assessment of what you think my software engineering and design skill level is, and areas of strength and weakness (i.e., room for improvement. Then, provide your honest feedback on my own feedback, with a specific focus on recommendations and observations that could help me work even more effectively with you going forward. Remember, the goal of this review is to help us work better together.


----------------


Thanks for the helpful feedback! It gave me an idea. Could you please create a new "design\instruction-recs.md" file for the purpose to documenting clear, practical recommendations on crafting prompt instructions for AI coding assistant in both general and specific scenarios within the Hangar Bay project? Its primary purpose will be for human reference, but the information within could be useful for AIs as well. For that reason, prioritize utility to humans for this file and include a specific note within it to document that instruction, since nearly everywhere else will prioritize utility to AI coding assistants. Use your "Recommendations for Even More Effective Collaboration Going Forward" from the assessment as a starting point.

After creating that file, update design-log.md with a new entry documenting both my request for an honest assessment of my feedback and the new instruction-recs.md file that came as a result of that assessment.


----------------


I realized we would benefit from one more general spec before proceeding with features. That spec is forn internationalization, often referred to as "i18n". 
1. Think about why internationalization is important in software development, especially for a public web service like Hangar Bar. While Hangar Bay's primary language will be English, it's important that we build in i18n capabilities from the beginning so the app is accessible to international markets.
2. Think about how and what i18n principles and implementation guidance could apply to Hangar Bay and our chosen tech stack. 
3. Think about how those i18n items might interact with other design specs, such as (but not limited to) accessibility-spec.md.
4. Then, create a new i18n spec file \design\i18n-spec.md and populate it as appropriate based on the earlier steps. The i18n spec should be structured in the context of being useful to an AI coding assistant ensuring internationalization requirements are always met while developing the application.
5. After creating i18n-spec.md, review it for potential improvements, especially those that would help an AI coding assistant during implementation of this project, and make those changes.
6. Then, update design-spec.md to include i18n as and where appropriate, and add references to the i18n-spec.md in areas you assess as relevant, like we've done with the other topic-specific design specs.
7. Finally, update design-log.md with a new entry to reflect the inclusion of i18n in the project.


----------------


A few notes:
1. In i18n-spec.md, section "3.1. Backend (FastAPI)", you specify using fastapi-babel and pybabel for i18n support. In your thought process earlier, you also mention python-i18n. Why did you select Babel? Please compare the options in the context of their suitability for the Hangar Bay project. 

2. In i18n-spec.md, section 3.3. "Data Handling (ESI vs. Application-Specific)", you say "If ESI does not support a user's selected locale for a specific endpoint/data, fall back gracefully to a default language (e.g., `en-us`) from ESI.". Let's explicitly make "en-us" the default language. Update any mentions of an example default language to clearly state that the default language is "en-us" and record that decision anywhere appropriate where it would be helpful to an AI coding assistant. 

3. In design-spec.md, you made changes to section 10. UI/UX Considerations that removed many mobile-related items in favor of i18n ones. Why did that happen?
3.1 For reference here is the removed text. Please careful review it, identify important items and details, and then make a corrective update to the 10. UI/UX Considerations section that includes those as well as the i18n items:

        *   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize assets (images, scripts, styles) for faster loading on mobile networks. Consider techniques like lazy loading for images and non-critical components.
        *   **Readability:** Ensure text is legible across all screen sizes with appropriate font sizes, line heights, and contrast ratios.
        *   **AI Action: Accessibility:** Design and implement with accessibility in mind from the start. Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. Refer to `accessibility-spec.md` for detailed requirements and ensure Angular Material/CDK accessibility features are leveraged.
        *   **Progressive Enhancement/Graceful Degradation:** Design with a mobile-first approach or ensure graceful degradation so core functionality remains accessible on less capable devices or browsers.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test on various emulated mobile viewports (using browser developer tools) and, where possible, on a range of real mobile devices. (Refer to `test-spec.md` for detailed testing requirements).
*   **AI Action: Minimalism and Focus:** Design UIs that avoid clutter. Present only relevant information and actions to the user to maintain focus on the core tasks.
*   **AI Action: Performance and Responsiveness:** Ensure the application loads quickly and responds promptly to user interactions. Implement optimized data loading and rendering strategies. See `performance-spec.md` (to be created).
*   **AI Action: Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language (colors, typography, layout, component behavior) throughout the application, leveraging Angular Material theming.
*   **AI Action: Error Handling and Feedback:** Implement clear, user-friendly error messages and feedback mechanisms for user actions (e.g., loading indicators, success/failure notifications using snackbars or toasts).
*   **AI Action: Trust and Security Cues:** Visually reinforce trust and security in the UI elements, especially around authentication and user data sections. Use iconography and language that conveys security.

4. In "3. Interaction with Other Design Specs", you raised relevant interactions with accessibility-spec.md and test-spec.md. Please update those files with the points you raised in the appropriate areas, and explicitly cross-reference i18n-spec.md in them. Be careful not to lose important details in those specs, like happened in design-spec.md as detailed above.

5. In design-log.md retroactively update the "Internationalization Specification Integration" entry to mention updates to the accessibility-spec.md and test-spec.md files. Also add another sentence to the rationale discussing EVE Online's global player base as a consideration for the importance of i18n for Hangar Bay.


----------------


Great job on the i18n items and corrections. Let's prepare a git commit for the i18n related updates to the new and updated spec.md files.

After that commit, here's the next item to work on:
In design-spec.md, section 10. UI/UX Considerations, you have item:
*   **AI Action: Performance and Responsiveness (General):** Ensure the application loads quickly and responds promptly to user interactions. Implement optimized data loading and rendering strategies. (See `performance-spec.md`, to be created).

Let's discuss that performance-spec.md. Please explain how or why having a separate performance could be helpful. Consider if there's any way it could be detrimental, such as by duplicating information in a way that could potentially confuse an AI coding assistant. Think through pros and cons. If you determine having a performance-spec.md would be beneficial to the project, carefully think through what would be most helpful to an AI coding assistant to include in it, then create the file and write the performance spec with a general structure similar to the other design spec files.


----------------


Before we commit anything. I see performance-spec.md references several other *-spec.md files. Please check each of those spec files and update them as appropriate with information and cross-references to the new performance-spec.md. In design-spec.md, I see a single new entry of "**AI Action: Performance and Responsiveness (General):**" - consider if there are any other areas of design-spec.md where it would benefit an AI coding assistant to have performance-spec.md mentioned.

Then, in design-log.md, retroactively update the"Performance Specification Creation" entry to reflect changes to any other spec files related to performance-spec.md.

Then, update the README.md in the project root to reflect information about the i18n and performance spec updates.

Then prepare the commit.


----------------


An important note. This project is published to a public Github repository. File paths in spec.md and other files must NEVER contain full absolute paths, which reveal my name and local file structure. They must ALWAYS use relative paths to the project root. Create a memory to capture this important instruction.

Next, I saw you made this good update:
"Update design/features/00-feature-spec-template.md: Add performance considerations and references to performance-spec.md."
Updating 00-feature-spec-template.md was a good idea because it's the basis for all our feature specs. I looked at it and didn't see the i18n-spec.md we recently created mentioned. This is a good time to do a careful review of 00-feature-spec-template.md to make it as useful as possible for an AI coding assistant, like evaluating where using the "**AI Assistant Guidance:**" and similar instructions we discussed that would be helpful to AI coding assistant would provide value. Then, make any updates to it referencing our expanded set of design\*-spec.md spec files that would be beneficial to an AI coding assistant. Not all specs will be always be applicable, so remember that you can use tags like "Optional" and "Required" to provide contextual hints. 

After updating 00-feature-spec-template.md, we should review feature specs F001 - F007 and align them with the updated 00-feature-spec-template.md. You must do this review EXTREMELY CAREFULLY and one feature spec file at a time. Be absolutely sure to not lose ANY important information when you make changes. Also take this opportunity to look for any areas where the feature spec could be enhanced to be more useful to AI coding assistants. Review your own work against these criteria and provide an assessment. Only once you're confident the feature spec is aligned in relevant ways with the 00-feature-spec-template.md for consistency, retained all important information, and is structured to be as helpful as possible to an AI coding assistant can you proceed to working on the next feature spec.


----------------


1. Update security-spec.md to include that user-facing error messages must never reveal sensitive information or internal service details in accordance with secure coding best practices. Put this in an appropriate section. 

2. Should we update 00-feature-spec-template.md to include links to the ESI API swagger / OpenAPI definition and developer documentation as a context hint since many features will leverage that API. Would having the link to the authoriative source potentially help prevent an AI assistant from hallucinating ESI API details or otherwise be helpful? If so, explain why, then determine if you have the information you need to make that to update 00-feature-spec-template.md. If not, let me know what information you need and I'll get it for you. 

3 Is there any risk you've hallucinated ESI API details in any of the feature specs so far? In the recent updates to the feature spec files to align them with the updated 00-feature-spec-template.md, it looks like you added a LOT of ESI API details in features that deal with that API. Have you been using the authoritative ESI API reference to construct those? It's better to identify any errors now rather than during implementation. Please carefully review, reporting your findings, and make any correction if necessary.

4. In the "Dependencies" section of each F001 - F007 feature spec.md document, other features are referenced only by their feature number (e.g., "F001"). To make this section more useful to an AI assistant, please update each feature dependency reference to include the actual feature spec file, like we've done with the design spec.md files.

5. In this chat, I see tool call output from you like "Analyzed F007-Alerts-Notifications.md:(1-200)" that seems to indicate you ingest file text in 200 line chunks. Is that true? What happens if a file has more than 200 lines? Help me understand practical considerations for maximizing effectiveness working with you and Windstream. Should we try to keep spec files under 200 lines? Does our spec file structure with clear sections explicitly designed to help AI coding assistants mitigate this? Is there anything else I should be aware of or consider in this area?


----------------


It looks like you proceeded with the API hallucination review before I'd provided the authoritative API reference and developer resource links.
You requested the following information:
"Information Needed: To make this update, I need the official URLs for:
The ESI Swagger/OpenAPI specification (this is often a .json or .yaml file, or a URL to a Swagger UI instance).
The main ESI developer documentation portal/website."

Here are links. 
* https://esi.evetech.net/ui/ - ESI API Swagger UI / OpenAPI spec
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/overview/ - official developer documentation landing page
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/esi/best-practices/ - official developer documentation - best practices
* https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/sso/ - official developer documentation - single sign-on guidance

For the link, in the "Why it's helpful:" section of your response, you said:
"Focused AI Prompts: You can explicitly direct an AI assistant to "refer to the linked ESI Swagger definition at [link] to confirm the request/response schema for endpoint X" when generating implementation details."
Is that something it could be helpful to integrate into our feature spec template and existing feature specs as an AI Actionable Checklist item (or similar instruction) for ESI API-related items? If so, please update 00-feature-spec-template.md with that change along with the API links.


----------------


Before we proceed with reviewing and aligning the existing feature specs (F001-F007) with this updated template, I've noticed you're consistently having trouble with expected vs actual names for the feature spec files and having to run partial match searches to find them. Would having a /design/features/feature-index.md file that simply contained list mapping feature ID like "F001" to feature name and the feature spec.md file path? The property names can align with those in the feature spec files. For example, in table format:
Feature ID, Feature Spec, Feature Spec Path
F005, Saved Searches, .\F005-Saved-Searches.md

Please carefully consider if something like this would be useful to you, or if there's a better way to address the issue. It you think it would be  helpful, consider if there's any way the feature-index.md file could be enhanced to be more useful to an AI assistant, and create the file with those in mind.


-----------------


1. I'm glad we have the feature-index.md file now. However, I'm wondering how we can keep it consistently updated as we add and modify features without a human having to manually prompt to update it every time. Can you propose and implement any solutions? One idea I had is for you to create a memory to check if any feature-index.md updates are appropriate whenever we create new feature specs or update existing ones. You might have better ideas though. Having the most effective solution is the most important.

2. Update design-log.md with a new entry describing the feature-index.md file, the thought process behind it, the problem it solves, and our strategy for keeping it updated by the AI coding assistant (you).


-----------------


1. I think "memory (ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6) detailing a procedure for you (the AI coding assistant) to help keep design/features/feature-index.md updated. This procedure involves checking for changes after feature spec modifications, extracting relevant metadata, and proposing updates to you for feature-index.md." is a critical evolution in us working effectively together towards bringing the Hangar Bay project to fruition. 

2. I think it's critically important that we document procedures like this one in a persistent manner, both to keep a record and learn from. We should keep a record of such procedures, including the problem they attempt to address, the detailed thoughts that went into their creation, and their implementation details, structured with sufficient specificity to be easily recreated in a different project. We could keep these records in a well-structured markdown file like "\design\ai-system-procedures.md". What do you think? How could this idea be executed in the most effective way? While as always we want it to be as useful as possible to AI coding assistants because they may need to re-implement procedures from this record, it's important humans can learn from it too. 
Please:
* carefully think through the matter of recording this type of AI coding assistant procedure
* propose an approach to address it
* critically evaluate your proposal and assess it for areas of improvement
* update the proposal if and as appropriate
* implement it
* add a new entry to design-log.md describing what you implemented, the type of procedure we're capturing with this record in categorical terms, the rationale for recording them, and why the ai-system-procedures.md (whatever the file is named) file contains the information it does


-----------------


I have an idea to try a test of "design\ai-system-procedures.md" to assess the "Reproducibility: The level of detail should allow for understanding and potential re-implementation." criteria. Here's my idea:
* You read "design\ai-system-procedures.md"
* Create a temp memory based on the specification and details for AISP-001 in the document. You'll delete the temp memory after the test.
* Compare that tempo memory to memory ID: 8ab3f7a9-9f10-42c1-a282-b8ad6eefe5b6, the original one you used to write the AISP-001 specification
* Identify any differences, gaps, or deficiencies between the two memories
* If there are any, critically think about why they occurred. 
* You mentioned "Complexity of "Detailed Steps": Finding the right balance between sufficient detail for AI and avoiding excessive rigidity is key. The steps should outline what to do and key decisions, rather than scripting every single token of an AI's thought process." as a consideration. If differences reasonably fall within that "right balance" area, there isn't necessarily any action we should take.
* Comprehensively report back before taking any actions to modify "design\ai-system-procedures.md"

1. What do you think of this testing idea? Would it be effective? Why or why not? If not, how could it be improved? For example, would you recent context window interfere with the test to the point of making it invalid for assessment. It's okay if so! If there's a viable test idea here, then please create a test plan. If not, explain why as clearly as you can.


-----------------


I appreciate the thought and detail you put into this assessment. I confirm I'm comfortable proceeding with the understanding of the context bias. Please proceed conducting the test plan as outlined. 

create a test plan. If not, explain why as clearly as you can.


-----------------


I like this suggestion for potential improvement you had:
"Perhaps a note in AISP-001's "Supporting Implementation Details" or "Notes for Human Reviewers" could mention that when this procedure is encoded into an AI's memory, the memory's "Rationale" section should ideally focus on the benefits/outcomes of the procedure (similar to the original memory's Rationale, and drawing from AISP-001's "Expected Outcome" section), while the AISP document itself already covers the design rationale of the procedure. This is a very fine point about how memories vs. design docs might be structured."
Understanding the benefits/outcomes can be extremely helpful in guiding the "why" of behavior by enabling better understanding of intent. Please update AISP in ai-system-procedures.md accordingly.


-----------------


Your comment "Clarifying how the "Rationale" in an operational AI memory should differ from the detailed "Rationale & Design Philosophy" in the AISP document can indeed help in crafting more effective memories that focus the AI on the why in terms of impact." triggered a thought from me about how to capture that for future AISP entries.
 
I think it could be helpful to have a template entry within ai-system-procedures.md that lays out the sections we have for AISP-001 with guidance that would be helpful for an AI coding assistant like Cascade to reference when constructing future entries. This is similar in concept to how we built \design\features\00-feature-spec-template.md to help Cascade with consistency and intent for individual feature spec.md documents. What do you think? What would make this most effective? Think through, then implement that.


-----------------



It would be good to update the design-log.md "## AI System Procedure Documentation" entry to incorporate the thought process behind and implementation of the AISP-000 templating approach and the benefits we expect that to provide for future AISPs.
