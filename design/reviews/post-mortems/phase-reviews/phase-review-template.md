        *   **AI/Cascade Learning:** (Specific, actionable learning for Cascade)
    *   (Add more as needed)
*   **New Tools/Technologies/Patterns Adopted:**
    *   (e.g., new library, a specific design pattern implemented effectively)
*   **Positive Surprises / Unexpected Wins:**
    *   (What went unexpectedly well or if a tool/approach was much more effective than anticipated?)
*   **Surprising Outcomes or Unexpected Behaviors (Neutral/Negative):**
    *   (Anything that didn't go as planned and what was learned, focusing on neutral or areas for improvement not covered by challenges)

## 4. Process Learnings & Improvements

*   **Workflow Enhancements/Issues:**
    *   (What worked well in the development process? What caused friction?)
*   **Documentation Practices:**
    *   (Effectiveness of task files, design docs, AI guidance, etc.)
*   **AI Collaboration (USER & Cascade):**
    *   (What interaction patterns were effective? What could be improved?)
*   **Suggestions for Future Phases (Process-wise):**
    *   (e.g., "Introduce formal X earlier", "Standardize Y process")

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review (Phase-Level)

*   **Security:**
    *   (Overall security posture of deliverables in this phase. Any new risks identified or mitigated? Adherence to `security-spec.md`.)
*   **Observability:**
    *   (Logging, monitoring, tracing implemented or improved. Adherence to `observability-spec.md`.)
*   **Testing:**
    *   (Test coverage, types of tests implemented, any gaps. Adherence to `test-spec.md`.)
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   (If applicable to this phase, e.g., UI components. Adherence to `accessibility-spec.md`.)
*   **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   (If applicable. Adherence to `i18n-spec.md`.)
*   **Performance:**
    *   (Any performance considerations, optimizations, or bottlenecks identified/addressed?. Adherence to `performance-spec.md`.)

## 6. Key Decisions & Justifications (Technical & Process)

*   (List any significant technical, architectural, or process decisions made or reinforced during this phase)
*   (Justification for these decisions)
*   (Cross-reference with `design-log.md` entry IDs where applicable)

## 7. Unresolved Issues & Technical Debt

*   **Status of Carry-over from Previous Phase:**
    *   (List each carry-over item from the previous phase's 'Recommendations' or 'Technical Debt' sections and its current status: Addressed, Partially Addressed, Not Addressed, Deferred. Briefly explain. Mark as N/A if this is the first phase.)
*   **Known Bugs/Limitations (This Phase):**
    *   (Detail any known bugs, limitations, or areas where the implementation fell short of desired functionality *introduced or discovered in this phase*.)
*   **Technical Debt Incurred (This Phase):**
    *   (List any technical debt incurred during this phase, e.g., shortcuts taken, areas needing refactoring, missing tests.)
*   **Carry-over Tasks to Next Phase:**
    *   (Any tasks that were planned for this phase but deferred)

## 8. Recommendations for Subsequent Phases

*   **Technical Recommendations:**
    *   (e.g., "Investigate X technology", "Refactor Y component")
*   **Process Recommendations:**
    *   (Already covered in 4.4, but can reiterate key ones here)
*   **Focus Areas for Next Phase:**
    *   (Based on learnings, what should be prioritized or watched out for?)
*   **Specific Memories to Create/Update based on this Phase's Learnings:**
    *   (Suggest specific, actionable memories for Cascade based on key learnings, especially from 'AI/Cascade Learning' or significant 'Challenges & Resolutions'. Indicate if it's a new memory or an update to an existing one. Be specific about the memory content and title.)

## 9. AI Assistant (Cascade) Performance & Feedback

*   **What Cascade Did Well:**
    *   (Specific examples of helpful actions, insights, or proactivity)
    *   *Identify any specific phrasing of requests or interaction patterns from the USER that were particularly effective in eliciting the desired response or action from Cascade.*
*   **Areas for Cascade Improvement:**
    *   (Constructive feedback on where Cascade could have performed better or missed opportunities)
*   **Effectiveness of Memories/Guidance:**
    *   (Did existing memories or AI guidance in documents prove useful? Any suggestions for new memories or refining existing ones based on this phase?)
