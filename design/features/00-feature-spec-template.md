## 4. Scope (Required)
### 4.1. In Scope
*   Clearly list what functionalities and components are included in this feature.
    *   [Item 1]
    *   [Item 2]
### 4.2. Out of Scope
*   Clearly list what is *not* part of this feature, to avoid scope creep. This might include related functionalities planned for later or explicitly excluded.
    *   [Item 1]
    *   [Item 2]

## 5. Key Data Structures / Models (Optional, but often Required)
*   Describe any new or significantly modified data structures, database tables, or object models relevant to this feature.
*   Include field names, data types, and brief descriptions.
*   **Example Table: `watchlist_items`**
    *   `id`: INTEGER (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
    *   `user_id`: INTEGER (Foreign Key to `users` table)
    *   `ship_type_id`: INTEGER (EVE Online Type ID)
    *   `max_price`: DECIMAL
    *   `created_at`: TIMESTAMP
    *   `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP

## 6. API Endpoints Involved (Optional)
### 6.1. Consumed ESI API Endpoints
*   List any EVE ESI API endpoints this feature will interact with.
*   Specify:
    *   HTTP Method and Path (e.g., `GET /v1/contracts/public/{region_id}/`)
    *   Key data fields to be extracted.
    *   Relevant ESI scopes required (if any).
    *   Caching considerations.
*   **Endpoint 1:**
    *   Path: [...]
    *   Fields: [...]
### 6.2. Exposed Hangar Bay API Endpoints
*   Define any new or modified backend API endpoints this feature will expose for the frontend or other services.
*   Specify:
    *   HTTP Method and Path (e.g., `POST /api/v1/watchlist`)
    *   Request Payload Structure (with example).
    *   Success Response Structure (with example, status code).
    *   Error Response Structures (with examples, status codes).
*   **Endpoint 1:**
    *   Path: [...]
    *   Request: [...]
    *   Success Response: [...]
    *   Error Responses: [...]

## 7. Workflow / Logic Flow (Optional)
*   Describe the step-by-step workflow or logic for the feature.
*   This can be a numbered list, a simple flowchart described in text, or pseudo-code.
*   Example:
    1.  User clicks "Add to Watchlist" on a ship.
    2.  Frontend sends request to `POST /api/v1/watchlist` with `ship_type_id` and `max_price`.
    3.  Backend validates input (user authenticated, valid `ship_type_id`, numeric `max_price`).
    4.  If validation fails, return 4xx error.
    5.  Backend stores the item in the `watchlist_items` table.
    6.  Backend returns 201 Created with the new watchlist item.

## 8. UI/UX Considerations (Optional)
*   Describe key UI elements, user interactions, or visual design considerations.
*   Reference mockups or wireframes if they exist (e.g., "Refer to mockup `watchlist-add-modal.png`").
*   Focus on what the user sees and does.
*   [Description of UI/UX elements]

## 9. Error Handling & Edge Cases (Required)
*   Identify potential error conditions, edge cases, and how the system should behave.
*   Example:
    *   ESI API unavailable: System should retry X times with exponential backoff, then log error and inform user if applicable.
    *   Invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric price): Return a clear error message to the user.
    *   User attempts to add duplicate watchlist item: System should inform user item already exists.

## 10. Security Considerations (Required)
*   Identify any feature-specific security concerns and how they will be addressed.
*   Reference relevant sections in `security-spec.md` or OWASP guidelines.
*   Examples:
    *   Input validation for all user-supplied data (see Section 3 of `security-spec.md`).
    *   Ensure only authenticated users can modify their own watchlist items (Authorization).
    *   Protection against mass assignment if using ORM for data creation/updates.

## 11. Performance Considerations (Optional)
*   Note any specific performance targets or potential bottlenecks.
*   Example:
    *   Adding a watchlist item should complete in < 500ms.
    *   ESI polling for alerts should not significantly impact overall application performance.

## 12. Dependencies (Optional)
*   List any dependencies this feature has on other features, modules, or external services (beyond ESI).
*   Example:
    *   Depends on Feature F002 (User Authentication) being complete.
    *   Requires SMTP service to be configured for email notifications.

## 13. Notes / Open Questions (Optional)
*   Record any outstanding questions, assumptions made, or points for further discussion.
*   [Note 1]
*   [Question 1]
