An ecommerce site for selling ships in the video game EVE Online.

Inspired by a friend who plays EVE and said:
"I can see where GPT could be useful for code snippets, but I cant imagine its able to deliver any sort of comprehensive outcome. If I say, "write me an ecommerce site for selling ships in eve online" theres no way its going to do that right?
It's going to give me some template code about a shopping cart or something and thats it. Right?"

There's only one way to find out!
