An ecommerce site for selling ships in the video game EVE Online.  For a friend who plays EVE and said "I can see where GPT could be useful for code snippets, but I cant imagine its able to deliver any sort of comprehensive outcome. If I say, "write me an ecommerce site for selling ships in eve online" there's no way its going to do that right?"
