# --- Test Setup and Fixture Philosophy ---
#
# The tests in this file follow a specific pattern to ensure reliability and
# consistency, as defined in `design/fastapi/guides/09-testing-strategies.md`.
#
# Key Fixtures:
#
# - `client: AsyncClient`: Provided by `conftest.py`, this is an HTTPX client
#   that makes requests to a *real* instance of our FastAPI application. This
#   ensures we are testing against the actual application code, including all
#   routers and dependencies.
#
# - `db_session: AsyncSession`: Also from `conftest.py`, this fixture provides
#   a clean, isolated, in-memory SQLite database session for each individual
#   test function. It handles the creation and teardown of the database schema,
#   ensuring tests do not interfere with each other.
#
# How They Work Together:
# The `client` fixture uses the `test_app` fixture, which programmatically
# overrides the `get_db` dependency to point to the `db_session` for that
# specific test. This gives us the best of both worlds: testing the real app
# logic against a safe, temporary database.
#
# Data Persistence in Tests:
# To save data to the database within a test, use `await db_session.flush()`.
# Do NOT use `await db_session.commit()`, as the fixture manages the
# transaction lifecycle.
