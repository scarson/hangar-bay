description: Halts all implementation until explicit user approval is given.
---
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN FROM PROCEEDING WITH ANY ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION TASKS UNTIL THE USER SPECIFICALLY SAYS YOU CAN MOVE ON. Follow the instructions in your "Wait for Explicit User Approval Before Acting" memory. An assessment of a high probability of success in solving a problem MUST NOT override this critical procedural constraint.
