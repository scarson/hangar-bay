# Task 02.1: ESI API Client (Public Endpoints)

**Phase:** 02 - Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To develop a robust ESI (EVE Swagger Interface) API client focused on accessing public contract-related endpoints necessary for F001. This includes handling requests, responses, ETag caching, and error management.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: ESI API Integration, Backend Architecture)
*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Specific ESI endpoints needed)
*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Rate limiting, user-agent)
*   `../../../design/performance-spec.md` (ETag usage, efficient data fetching)
*   EVE Online ESI Documentation (Official)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **HTTP Client Setup:**
    *   Choose and configure an HTTP client library (e.g., `httpx` for async).
    *   Set a proper User-Agent string as required by ESI guidelines.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate Python code to initialize an `httpx.AsyncClient` with a custom User-Agent header and appropriate timeouts."
*   [ ] **ESI Endpoint Wrappers (Public Contracts):**
    *   Identify specific ESI endpoints required by F001 (refer to `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md`, Section 6.1):
        *   `GET /v1/contracts/public/{region_id}/` (for fetching contracts per region)
        *   `GET /v1/contracts/public/items/{contract_id}/` (for fetching items within a contract)
        *   `GET /v3/universe/types/{type_id}/` (for resolving item/ship type details for caching in `esi_type_cache`)
        *   `POST /v1/universe/ids/` (for resolving names like characters, stations if needed during ingestion; F001 spec mentions this for `issuer_name` and `start_location_name`)
        *   Consider also `GET /v1/universe/regions/` if a list of all region IDs is needed dynamically.
    *   Create functions/methods to call these endpoints.
    *   Handle pagination for list endpoints.
    *   Implement ETag request and response header handling for caching.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Python function using `httpx` to fetch data from a paginated ESI endpoint like `/contracts/public/{region_id}/`, handling ETags and potential ESI errors (e.g., 404, 403, 5xx)."
*   [ ] **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for ESI API responses (e.g., 4xx, 5xx errors, timeouts, network issues).
    *   Define custom exceptions for specific ESI error scenarios if useful.
*   [ ] **Rate Limiting Awareness:**
    *   Implement logic to respect ESI rate limits (e.g., using response headers like `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Remain` and `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Reset`). Consider a simple delay mechanism or a more sophisticated token bucket/leaky bucket approach if needed.
*   [ ] **Configuration:**
    *   Ensure ESI base URL is configurable (though likely static).
    *   Client ID/Secret are not needed for public endpoints but plan for their future inclusion if the client is to be extended.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Prioritize `httpx` for asynchronous operations, aligning with FastAPI.
*   ETag handling is crucial for reducing load on ESI and improving performance.
*   Error handling should be comprehensive, logging ESI errors clearly.
*   Refer to the official ESI documentation for endpoint details and best practices.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   An ESI client module is created.
*   Functions for fetching public contracts and related data (e.g., regions, items within contracts) are implemented.
*   ETag caching and pagination are correctly handled.
*   Basic rate limiting considerations are in place.
*   Comprehensive error handling for ESI responses is implemented.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 5. Internationalization (I18n)

*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
