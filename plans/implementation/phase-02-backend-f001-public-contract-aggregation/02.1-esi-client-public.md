# Task 02.1: ESI API Client (Public Endpoints)

**Phase:** 02 - Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To develop a robust ESI (EVE Swagger Interface) API client focused on accessing public contract-related endpoints necessary for F001. This includes handling requests, responses, ETag caching, and error management.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: ESI API Integration, Backend Architecture)
*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Specific ESI endpoints needed)
*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Rate limiting, user-agent)
*   `../../../design/performance-spec.md` (ETag usage, efficient data fetching)
*   EVE Online ESI Documentation (Official)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **HTTP Client Setup:**
    *   Choose and configure an HTTP client library (e.g., `httpx` for async).
    *   Set a proper User-Agent string as required by ESI guidelines.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate Python code to initialize an `httpx.AsyncClient` with a custom User-Agent header and appropriate timeouts."
*   [ ] **ESI Endpoint Wrappers (Public Contracts):**
    *   Identify specific ESI endpoints for public contracts (e.g., `/contracts/public/{region_id}/`, `/contracts/public/items/{contract_id}/`, `/universe/regions/`).
    *   Create functions/methods to call these endpoints.
    *   Handle pagination for list endpoints.
    *   Implement ETag request and response header handling for caching.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Python function using `httpx` to fetch data from a paginated ESI endpoint like `/contracts/public/{region_id}/`, handling ETags and potential ESI errors (e.g., 404, 403, 5xx)."
*   [ ] **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for ESI API responses (e.g., 4xx, 5xx errors, timeouts, network issues).
    *   Define custom exceptions for specific ESI error scenarios if useful.
*   [ ] **Rate Limiting Awareness:**
    *   Implement logic to respect ESI rate limits (e.g., using response headers like `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Remain` and `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Reset`). Consider a simple delay mechanism or a more sophisticated token bucket/leaky bucket approach if needed.
*   [ ] **Configuration:**
    *   Ensure ESI base URL is configurable (though likely static).
    *   Client ID/Secret are not needed for public endpoints but plan for their future inclusion if the client is to be extended.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Prioritize `httpx` for asynchronous operations, aligning with FastAPI.
*   ETag handling is crucial for reducing load on ESI and improving performance.
*   Error handling should be comprehensive, logging ESI errors clearly.
*   Refer to the official ESI documentation for endpoint details and best practices.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   An ESI client module is created.
*   Functions for fetching public contracts and related data (e.g., regions, items within contracts) are implemented.
*   ETag caching and pagination are correctly handled.
*   Basic rate limiting considerations are in place.
*   Comprehensive error handling for ESI responses is implemented.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
