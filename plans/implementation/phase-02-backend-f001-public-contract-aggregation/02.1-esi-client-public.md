# Task 02.1: ESI API Client (Public Endpoints)

**Phase:** 02 - Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To develop a robust ESI (EVE Swagger Interface) API client focused on accessing public contract-related endpoints necessary for F001. This includes handling requests, responses, ETag caching, and error management.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: ESI API Integration, Backend Architecture)
*   `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Specific ESI endpoints needed)
*   `/design/specifications/security-spec.md` (Rate limiting, user-agent)
*   `/design/specifications/performance-spec.md` (ETag usage, efficient data fetching)
*   EVE Online ESI Documentation (Official)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Configuration:**
    *   Add `ESI_BASE_URL` and `ESI_USER_AGENT` to the Pydantic settings in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/config.py`. Ensure they are loaded from environment variables.
*   [ ] **HTTP Client Setup & Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Create a new module, e.g., `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/core/esi_client.py`.
    *   Within this module, define a singleton `httpx.AsyncClient`.
    *   In `main.py`, use FastAPI's `startup` and `shutdown` lifecycle events to initialize and close the `httpx` client, storing the client instance on `app.state.esi_client`. This follows the pattern established for the cache client in Phase 01.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to modify `main.py` to manage the lifecycle of a shared `httpx.AsyncClient`, initializing it on startup and closing it on shutdown, storing it on `app.state`."
*   [ ] **ESI Endpoint Wrappers (Public Contracts):**
    *   Identify specific ESI endpoints required by F001 (refer to `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md`, Section 6.1):
        *   `GET /v1/contracts/public/{region_id}/`
        *   `GET /v1/contracts/public/items/{contract_id}/`
        *   `GET /v3/universe/types/{type_id}/`
        *   `POST /v1/universe/ids/`
        *   `GET /v1/universe/regions/`
    *   Create functions/methods in `esi_client.py` to call these endpoints using the shared client from `app.state`.
    *   Handle pagination for list endpoints.
    *   **ETag Caching:** Implement ETag request/response header handling. Use the Valkey cache (from Phase 01) to store ETags and their corresponding response data. The cache key could be based on the ESI endpoint URL.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Python function using `httpx` to fetch data from a paginated ESI endpoint like `/contracts/public/{region_id}/`. The function should accept an async Redis client. It must handle ETag headers: on request, it should check the cache for a stored ETag and send the `If-None-Match` header. On response, if it's a 304, it should return the cached data; if it's a 200, it should update the cache with the new ETag and data."
*   [ ] **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for ESI API responses (e.g., 4xx, 5xx errors, timeouts, network issues).
    *   Define custom exceptions for specific ESI error scenarios (e.g., `ESIForbiddenError`, `ESIServerError`).
*   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Python function that accepts a list of integer IDs and uses the ESI `POST /v1/universe/ids/` endpoint to resolve them into names. The function should handle the 1,000 ID limit per request by batching the input list. It should return a dictionary mapping IDs to their resolved names and categories."
*   [ ] **Rate Limiting Awareness:**
    *   Implement logic to respect ESI rate limits (e.g., using response headers like `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Remain` and `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Reset`). For MVP, a simple sleep based on `X-Esi-Error-Limit-Reset` might suffice.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   **Configuration:** Manage all ESI-related settings (`ESI_BASE_URL`, `ESI_USER_AGENT`) in `config.py` using Pydantic `BaseSettings`, loading from environment variables. This centralizes configuration.
*   **Client Lifecycle:** Use FastAPI's `startup`/`shutdown` events to manage a single, shared `httpx.AsyncClient` instance. Store it on `app.state` to ensure connections are reused efficiently and closed gracefully. This avoids creating new clients for every request.
*   **ETag Caching:** Integrate ETag handling directly with the Valkey cache established in Phase 01. When you get a response with an ETag, store both the ETag and the response data in Valkey. On subsequent requests, retrieve the ETag from cache and use the `If-None-Match` header. A `304 Not Modified` response means you can serve the data directly from your cache.
*   **Error Handling:** Wrap ESI calls in `try...except` blocks to catch `httpx` exceptions and handle non-2xx responses. Log errors with structured information (endpoint, status code, error message).
*   **CRITICAL LOGGING REMINDER:** Remember the lesson from Phase 01: if your logs from `esi_client.py` or other new modules are not appearing, **ensure `logging.basicConfig()` is configured in `main.py`**. Uvicorn will not display logs from your modules without this root logger configuration.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   An ESI client module is created.
*   Functions for fetching public contracts and related data (e.g., regions, items within contracts) are implemented.
*   ETag caching and pagination are correctly handled.
*   Basic rate limiting considerations are in place.
*   Comprehensive error handling for ESI responses is implemented.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Potential Challenge:** Logs from the new ESI client module may not appear in the console.
    *   **Proactive Resolution:** Verify that `logging.basicConfig()` is present and correctly configured in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py`. This was a key lesson from Phase 01.
*   (Placeholder for other challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** The client will only access public, read-only ESI endpoints, minimizing risk. A proper `User-Agent` string will be set, which is a compliance requirement for ESI.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** While the client itself doesn't take user input, any parameters passed to it (like `region_id`) should be validated by the calling service.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A for this internal client.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A, as only public endpoints are being used.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** `ESI_USER_AGENT` will be managed via Pydantic settings and environment variables, not hardcoded. This prepares for future secrets like `ESI_CLIENT_ID`.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** `httpx` will be added to `pyproject.toml` and locked with PDM.
*   **Notes:** The primary security measure is adhering to ESI's User-Agent policy. The design avoids handling sensitive data or authenticated endpoints for this task.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** While full structured logging is a future task, log messages should be informative.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** Log outgoing ESI requests (URL, params), cache hits/misses for ETags, and successful data fetching.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Log ESI API errors with the endpoint, status code, and any error message returned from the API. Use `logging.exception()` or `exc_info=True` for network errors to capture stack traces.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A for this client, but will be important for the API endpoints that use it.
*   [x] **Metrics:** Consider logging the duration of ESI API calls to identify slow endpoints.
*   **Notes:** **Crucially, ensure `logging.basicConfig()` is set in `main.py` to make these logs visible.** Logging should provide a clear picture of the client's interactions with the ESI API and the cache.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Unit tests should be written for the ESI client's logic. Use a library like `pytest-httpx` to mock the `httpx.AsyncClient` and simulate various ESI responses (e.g., 200 OK, 304 Not Modified, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error) without making real network calls.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** Integration tests will be written for the services that *use* the ESI client, not for the client itself.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage on the client's error handling, pagination, and ETag logic.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** Store example ESI JSON responses as files in a `tests/fixtures` directory to be used by the mock HTTP client.
*   **Notes:** The key to testing this component is to effectively mock the external ESI dependency. This allows for fast, reliable, and isolated unit tests.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
