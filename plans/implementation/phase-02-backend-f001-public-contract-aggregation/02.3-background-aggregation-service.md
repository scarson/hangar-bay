# Task 02.3: Background Aggregation Service

**Phase:** 02 - Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To implement a background service/task that periodically fetches public contract data from ESI for relevant regions, processes it, and stores/updates it in the local database using the defined data models and ESI client.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Background Processing, Data Aggregation)
*   `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Data freshness requirements)
*   Task 02.1: ESI API Client (Public Endpoints)
*   Task 02.2: Data Models for F001

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [X] **Choose and Integrate Background Task Framework:**
    *   **Decision:** We will use `APScheduler` with `AsyncIOScheduler` for its simplicity and direct integration with `asyncio`.
    *   **Integration:** The scheduler instance must be managed via FastAPI's lifecycle events. It should be initialized and started on `startup` and gracefully shut down on `shutdown`. This follows the pattern established in Phase 1 for managing shared resources.
    *   **Dependency:** Add `apscheduler` to the project's dependencies using PDM.
*   [X] **Aggregation Logic:**
    *   **Concurrency Lock:** Implement a locking mechanism (e.g., a specific key in the Valkey cache) to ensure only one instance of the aggregation job runs at a time. The job should check for the lock at the start and exit immediately if it's already held. It must release the lock upon completion or failure.
    *   **Service Class:** Create a dedicated service class (e.g., `ContractAggregationService`) to encapsulate the aggregation logic. This class should be instantiated with dependencies like the database session and ESI client.
    *   **Configuration:** Load the list of target `region_id`s and the job's scheduler interval (e.g., 15 minutes) from the application's Pydantic settings (`config.py`).
    *   **Region Iteration:** The service should iterate over the configured list of region IDs.
    *   **Data Fetching & Processing:** For each region, use the ESI client to fetch contracts and their items. Implement robust error handling for ESI API calls, logging errors without crashing the entire job.
    *   **Resolve IDs to Names:** For each new contract, resolve `issuer_id` and `start_location_id` to human-readable names using the ESI client (`POST /universe/ids/`) and store them in the `contracts` table to denormalize for performance.
    *   **Data Transformation:** Transform the raw ESI data into the SQLAlchemy models (`Contract`, `ContractItem`, `EsiTypeCache`).
    *   **Implement Business Logic for Ship Contracts:**
        *   **Definition:** A "ship contract" is defined as an `item_exchange` contract containing exactly one packaged item (`is_singleton=True`) that belongs to a known ship group.
        *   **Logic:**
            1.  During aggregation, after fetching contract items, check if a contract meets the definition.
            2.  To verify if an item is a ship, check its `group_id` from the `EsiTypeCache`.
            3.  Maintain a configurable list of ship `group_id`s in Pydantic settings (e.g., Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, etc.).
            4.  If the criteria are met, set the `Contract.is_ship_contract` flag to `True`. Then, copy all relevant details from the primary ship `ContractItem` to the `Contract` record: `ship_type_id`, `quantity`, `is_blueprint_copy`, `runs`, `material_efficiency`, and `time_efficiency`.
            5.  Additionally, if the total number of items in the contract is greater than one, set the `Contract.contains_additional_items` flag to `True`.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Simplification Challenge):** The logic for identifying ship contracts and denormalizing specific fields, while necessary, adds complexity to the main aggregation loop. If this logic becomes significantly more intricate in the future, consider refactoring it into a separate, testable component or step in the processing pipeline.
    *   **Database Upsert:** Use an efficient `upsert` strategy to insert new records and update existing ones. Batch operations to reduce database round-trips.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Python class `ContractAggregationService` that orchestrates the public contract aggregation. It should include:
        1. An `__init__` method to accept a DB session, ESI client, and cache client.
        2. A `run_aggregation` async method that:
                      a. Implements a cache-based lock to prevent concurrent runs. **Crucially, if the lock cannot be checked due to a cache connection error, the method must log a critical error and exit immediately without running the aggregation (failing 'closed' or 'safe').**
           b. Fetches a list of region IDs from settings.
           c. Iterates through regions, logging progress and handling ESI errors gracefully. **Pre-mortem Note (Poison Pill Data):** Within each region, wrap the processing of individual contracts (or small batches of contracts) in `try...except` blocks. If a specific contract's data causes an unrecoverable error during transformation or DB preparation, log the problematic `contract_id` and details, skip that contract, and continue with the next in the region. This prevents one bad data item from halting all processing for a region.
           d. For each region, fetches contracts and items, using the ESI client's ETag caching.
           e. Manages the `EsiTypeCache` by upserting newly discovered `type_id`s.
            f. **Implements a data refresh policy:** At the start of each run, it queries for a small number of `EsiTypeCache` records where `last_refreshed_at` is older than a configured threshold (e.g., 30 days). It then re-fetches and updates these records from ESI. If a specific type consistently fails to refresh (e.g., due to ESI errors for that type_id), log the error and update its `last_refreshed_at` timestamp to prevent it from being immediately re-selected in the next run, thus avoiding repeated futile calls. This ensures local data doesn't become stale while being resilient to problematic individual types.
           g. Upserts contract and item data to the database in batches.
           h. Logs a summary at the end (total contracts processed, types refreshed, duration, errors).
           i. Ensures the lock is released in a `finally` block. **Pre-mortem Note:** The lock release itself should be in a nested `try...except` to catch potential cache errors during release, logging them critically but ensuring the main aggregation error (if any) is not masked. Log the success or failure of the lock release explicitly."
*   [X] **Market Group Aggregation:** Implement a separate, less frequently run job (e.g., once daily) within the same service to fetch and populate the `EsiMarketGroupCache` table using the `GET /v1/markets/groups/` ESI endpoint. This data changes very rarely.
*   [X] **Scheduling:**
    *   Configure the chosen scheduler (`APScheduler`) to run the aggregation logic at regular intervals (e.g., every 15-30 minutes, configurable).
    *   Ensure the scheduler is started when the FastAPI application starts.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to integrate `APScheduler` with a FastAPI application to run a specific async function periodically."
*   [X] **Database Interaction:**
    *   The background task cannot use the standard FastAPI `Depends` system. A new, independent database session must be created for the duration of the job run. Create a utility that provides a session and ensures it is closed correctly, similar to the `get_db` context manager.
    *   Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 style `merge()` or provider-specific `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` statements for efficient upserts.
    *   Batch all database writes (e.g., using `session.add_all()`) to minimize I/O.
*   [X] **Structured Logging:**
    *   **CRITICAL:** Ensure `logging.basicConfig()` is called in `main.py` as discovered in Phase 1, otherwise logs from the scheduler may not be visible.
    *   Log the start and end of each aggregation run with a unique run ID for traceability.
    *   Log key statistics for each run: duration, number of regions processed, contracts fetched/updated, items processed, and errors encountered.
    *   Log cache hits/misses for ESI ETag checks to monitor efficiency.
    *   Log any error with a full stack trace, but allow the service to continue to the next region where possible. **Pre-mortem Note (Logging Volume):** Be mindful of logging levels within tight loops (e.g., per-contract processing). Use `DEBUG` for highly verbose logs and ensure production log levels are typically `INFO` or `WARNING` to manage log volume and cost.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Focus on resilience: the aggregator should handle ESI errors or temporary unavailability without crashing. If persistent database connection or commit errors occur, the aggregation run should be aborted, log a critical error, and ensure the concurrency lock is released.
*   Make region list and schedule interval configurable (via Pydantic settings).
*   Ensure efficient database updates (upserts) to avoid duplicates and keep data current. **Pre-mortem Note:** Carefully tune batch sizes for database upserts. Too small increases round-trips; too large can cause memory issues or long transaction times. Monitor DB performance during aggregation runs.
*   If using `APScheduler` with `asyncio`, ensure jobs are scheduled correctly in the event loop.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Scheduler Health):** Implement basic monitoring or logging for `APScheduler` itself. Log job submission, success, failure, and execution times. Consider setting up alerts if jobs fail repeatedly or if execution times deviate significantly, as this could indicate underlying issues (DB slowness, ESI issues, bugs).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   A background task mechanism (`APScheduler` or similar) is integrated.
*   Aggregation logic to fetch, process, and store contract data for specified regions is implemented.
*   The aggregation task is scheduled to run periodically.
*   Data is correctly upserted into the `Contract` and `ContractItem` tables.
*   Adequate logging is in place for monitoring the aggregation process.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Potential Challenge 1: Concurrent Job Runs**
    *   **Symptom:** If an aggregation run takes longer than the scheduled interval, a new job starts before the previous one finishes, causing race conditions, duplicated data, and excessive load.
    *   **Proactive Resolution:** Implement a robust locking mechanism using the cache (Valkey). The job must acquire a lock before starting and release it in a `finally` block to guarantee it's always released, even on error.

*   **Potential Challenge 2: Scheduler in Async Environment**
    *   **Symptom:** Scheduled jobs do not run, or they block the main application's event loop.
    *   **Proactive Resolution:** Use `APScheduler`'s `AsyncIOScheduler`. Ensure it is started and shut down correctly within FastAPI's `startup` and `shutdown` events. All scheduled jobs must be `async` functions.

*   **Potential Challenge 3: Scalability with Many Regions**
    *   **Symptom:** As the number of configured regions increases, the sequential processing of each region makes the total aggregation job duration excessively long.
    *   **Proactive Resolution (Future Consideration):** For MVP, sequential processing is acceptable. If job duration becomes an issue, explore parallel processing of regions (e.g., using `asyncio.gather` to run ESI calls and DB operations for multiple regions concurrently), ensuring that database connection pooling and ESI rate limits are respected.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** The service operates with least privilege, accessing only necessary public ESI endpoints and local database resources. It does not handle user input directly.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** Configuration inputs (e.g., region IDs from `settings.AGGREGATION_REGION_IDS`) are validated during settings parsing and at runtime within the service.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A. The service writes to the database; output encoding is relevant for API endpoints serving this data.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. The service runs as a trusted background process.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A for this service directly, as it uses public ESI endpoints. Relies on `ESI_USER_AGENT` from config.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** `APScheduler` is managed via PDM.
*   **Notes:** The service is designed to process public data. Configuration parameters like region IDs are validated. The service relies on the ESI client for secure ESI interaction (User-Agent).

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** Standard Python logging is used, providing informative messages with timestamps and log levels. Key events and errors are clearly logged.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** The service logs the start and end of each run, region processing, ESI interactions (including cache status), database operations, lock acquisition/release, and final summaries (contracts/items processed, errors).
*   [x] **Error Logging:** All exceptions during the process are logged with stack traces, including specific ESI errors, database errors, and cache errors.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** While not explicitly generated by the service, logs are timestamped and associated with specific job runs, allowing for correlation.
*   [x] **Metrics:** Key metrics are logged, including run duration, number of ESI calls, number of DB upserts, cache hit/miss status, and contracts/items processed/updated.
*   **Notes:** `logging.basicConfig()` is configured in `main.py`. Detailed logging provides comprehensive insight into the aggregation process, ESI interactions, and error conditions.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Core transformation logic within `ContractAggregationService` was functionally tested with real ESI data. Mocking ESI client and DB session for isolated unit tests is a good practice for future enhancements.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** The service was extensively tested in an integrated environment:
    1.  `APScheduler` was configured and observed to trigger the job correctly.
    2.  The live ESI API was used, verifying interactions with real success and error responses (e.g., 304 Not Modified, actual data).
    3.  A development database was used to verify correct data upsertion and schema compliance.
    4.  The Redis-based locking mechanism was tested and confirmed to prevent concurrent runs.
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** All critical paths, including data fetching, processing, ESI error handling, DB upsert, ETag caching, and concurrency locking, were functionally covered through iterative development and debugging.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** Real ESI responses and a live development database served as test data and environment.
*   **Notes:** The background aggregation service, including its scheduling, ESI interaction, data processing, database operations, and locking, was thoroughly tested and validated through iterative development, direct observation of logs, and database inspection.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** N/A. This task implements a backend service and has no direct user interface or CLI component.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** N/A for the service itself. It relies on the ESI client to handle character encoding from ESI (expected UTF-8) and the database driver to handle encoding for DB storage.
