# Task 02.2: Data Models for F001

**Phase:** 02 - Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To define SQLAlchemy data models for storing processed EVE Online contract data relevant to F001, including contracts, contract items, and any necessary supporting information (e.g., regions, stations, item types if not relying solely on SDE).

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Data Tier, Data Models)
*   `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Data fields required for display and filtering)
*   Task 01.2: Database Setup (SQLAlchemy `Base`)
*   EVE Online SDE (Static Data Export) for reference on data types and relationships.

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [X] **Identify Core Entities:**
    *   Based on F001, identify key entities to model:
        *   `Contract` (public contracts)
        *   `ContractItem` (items within contracts)
        *   `EsiTypeCache` (for caching item type details)
        *   `EsiMarketGroupCache` (for caching item market group details for F002 filtering)
*   [X] **Define `Contract` Model:**
    *   Create `app/models/contract.py` (or similar).
    *   Define `Contract` SQLAlchemy model inheriting from `Base`.
    *   Include fields like: `contract_id` (primary key), `issuer_id`, `issuer_corporation_id`, `assignee_id`, `start_location_id`, `end_location_id`, `type` (auction, item_exchange), `status`, `title`, `for_corporation`, `date_issued`, `date_expired`, `date_completed`, `price`, `reward`, `collateral`, `volume`, `region_id`.
    *   Define relationships (e.g., one-to-many with `ContractItem`).
    *   Add appropriate indexes for query performance (e.g., on `region_id`, `type`, `status`, `date_issued`, `title`, `start_location_name`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a SQLAlchemy model class `Contract` with the following fields, ensuring appropriate data types, nullability, and comments referencing ESI field names where applicable:\n`contract_id` (PK, BigInteger, ESI: `contract_id`),\n`region_id` (Integer, indexed, ESI: `region_id`),\n`issuer_id` (Integer, indexed, ESI: `issuer_id`),\n`issuer_corporation_id` (Integer, indexed, ESI: `issuer_corporation_id`),\n`issuer_name` (String(255), ESI: resolved `name` for `issuer_id`),\n`assignee_id` (Integer, nullable=True, ESI: `assignee_id`),\n`start_location_id` (BigInteger, nullable=True, ESI: `start_location_id`),\n`start_location_name` (String(255), nullable=True, ESI: resolved `name` for `start_location_id`),\n`type` (String(50), indexed, ESI: `type`),\n`status` (String(50), indexed, ESI: `status`),\n`title` (String(255), nullable=True, ESI: `title`),\n`for_corporation` (Boolean, ESI: `for_corporation`),\n`date_issued` (DateTime, indexed, ESI: `date_issued`),\n`date_expired` (DateTime, ESI: `date_expired`),\n`date_completed` (DateTime, nullable=True, ESI: `date_completed`),\n`price` (Numeric(20, 2), nullable=True, ESI: `price`),\n`reward` (Numeric(20, 2), nullable=True, ESI: `reward`),\n`collateral` (Numeric(20, 2), nullable=True, ESI: `collateral`),\n`volume` (Numeric(20, 4), nullable=True, ESI: `volume`),\n`is_ship_contract` (Boolean, default=False, derived field),\n`ship_type_id` (Integer, nullable=True, indexed, derived field),\n`quantity` (Integer, nullable=True, derived field from item),\n`is_blueprint_copy` (Boolean, nullable=True, derived field from item),\n`runs` (Integer, nullable=True, derived field from item),\n`material_efficiency` (Integer, nullable=True, derived field from item),\n`time_efficiency` (Integer, nullable=True, derived field from item),\n`contains_additional_items` (Boolean, default=False, derived field),\n`first_seen_at` (DateTime, server_default=func.now()),\n`last_updated_at` (DateTime, server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now()).\nInclude a one-to-many relationship to `ContractItem` named `items`.\nAdd a composite index on (`region_id`, `status`, `type`, `is_ship_contract`, `date_issued`).\nAlso add an index on `issuer_name` and `start_location_name` if they are expected to be frequently searched."
*   [X] **Define `ContractItem` Model:**
    *   In the same file or `app/models/contract_item.py`.
    *   Define `ContractItem` SQLAlchemy model.
    *   Include fields like: `record_id` (primary key from ESI), `contract_id` (foreign key to `Contract`), `type_id` (item type), `quantity`, `is_included`, `is_singleton`.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a SQLAlchemy model class `ContractItem` with the following fields, ensuring appropriate data types, nullability, and comments referencing ESI field names where applicable:\n`internal_item_id` (PK, BigInteger, autoincrement=True),\n`contract_id` (BigInteger, ForeignKey('contracts.contract_id'), nullable=False, indexed),\n`type_id` (Integer, nullable=False, indexed, ESI: `type_id`),\n`quantity` (Integer, nullable=False, ESI: `quantity`),\n`is_included` (Boolean, nullable=False, ESI: `is_included`),\n`is_singleton` (Boolean, nullable=False, ESI: `is_singleton`),\n`is_blueprint_copy` (Boolean, nullable=True, ESI: `is_blueprint_copy`),\n`material_efficiency` (Integer, nullable=True, ESI: `material_efficiency`),\n`runs` (Integer, nullable=True, ESI: `runs`),\n`time_efficiency` (Integer, nullable=True, ESI: `time_efficiency`).\nEnsure `contract_id` has a foreign key constraint to the `contracts` table's `contract_id` field.\nInclude a many-to-one relationship to `Contract` named `contract`."
*   [X] **Define `EsiTypeCache` Model:**
    *   In `app/models/esi_type_cache.py` (or similar).
    *   Define `EsiTypeCache` SQLAlchemy model inheriting from `Base`.
    *   This model is crucial for storing details of item types fetched from ESI's `/universe/types/{type_id}/` endpoint, as specified in F001 (Section 5.1.3).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a SQLAlchemy model class `EsiTypeCache` for caching ESI type information, with the following fields, ensuring appropriate data types, nullability, and comments referencing ESI field names where applicable:\n`type_id` (PK, Integer, ESI: `type_id`),\n`name` (String(255), nullable=False, indexed, ESI: `name`),\n`description` (Text, nullable=True, ESI: `description`),\n`group_id` (Integer, nullable=False, indexed, ESI: `group_id`),\n`market_group_id` (Integer, nullable=True, indexed, ESI: `market_group_id`),\n`volume` (Numeric(20, 4), nullable=True, ESI: `volume`),\n`packaged_volume` (Numeric(20, 4), nullable=True, ESI: `packaged_volume`),\n`portion_size` (Integer, nullable=False, ESI: `portion_size`),\n`published` (Boolean, nullable=False, ESI: `published`),\n`icon_id` (Integer, nullable=True, ESI: `icon_id`),\n`first_seen_at` (DateTime, server_default=func.now()),\n`last_refreshed_at` (DateTime, server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())."
*   [X] **Define `EsiMarketGroupCache` Model:**
    *   In `app/models/esi_market_group_cache.py` (or similar).
    *   Define `EsiMarketGroupCache` SQLAlchemy model inheriting from `Base`.
    *   This model is crucial for storing information about EVE Online market groups, which are used to categorize items (e.g., 'Frigates', 'Cruisers'). This is required for the ship category filtering in F002.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a SQLAlchemy model class `EsiMarketGroupCache` for caching ESI market group information, with the following fields, ensuring appropriate data types, nullability, and comments referencing ESI field names where applicable:\n`market_group_id` (PK, Integer, ESI: `market_group_id`),\n`name` (String(255), nullable=False, indexed, ESI: `name`),\n`description` (Text, nullable=True, ESI: `description`),\n`parent_group_id` (Integer, nullable=True, indexed, ESI: `parent_group_id`),\n`last_esi_check` (DateTime, server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())."
*   [X] **Alembic Migration:**
    *   **Step 1: Verify Model Imports.** Before generating, ensure your new model files (e.g., `contract.py`, `esi_type_cache.py`, `esi_market_group_cache.py`) are imported in `app/backend/src/alembic/env.py` so that `Base.metadata` is aware of them. Use a `# noqa: F401` comment to prevent linters from removing the import.
    *   **Step 2: Generate Migration.** Run `alembic revision -m "Add F001 contract models" --autogenerate`.
    *   **Step 3: Review Generated Script.** Carefully inspect the generated Python migration file in `alembic/versions/`. **If it is empty or missing changes, STOP.** It means Alembic did not detect your models (see Step 1).
    *   **Step 4: Apply the Migration.** If the script is correct, apply it: `alembic upgrade head`.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   **Data Integrity:** Use `Numeric` or `Decimal` data types for currency fields (`price`, `reward`, `collateral`) to avoid floating-point precision errors. Use `BigInteger` for IDs that might exceed the standard integer limit.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (ESI Schema Evolution):** ESI data structures can change. Regularly monitor ESI documentation. Be prepared to update SQLAlchemy models and create new Alembic migrations if ESI introduces new fields, changes data types, or alters enum values. The aggregation service should log warnings for unexpected fields or values encountered from ESI.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Unexpected Nulls):** ESI might occasionally return `null` for fields not explicitly documented as nullable. When mapping ESI data to SQLAlchemy models, be prepared to handle unexpected `null`s gracefully (e.g., by providing default values before attempting database insertion if appropriate for the field, or by ensuring the corresponding SQLAlchemy model field is `nullable=True` if the data is truly optional or sometimes absent). This can prevent database constraint violations.
*   **Performance:** Add database indexes (`index=True`) to foreign keys and any columns that will be frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN`s, or `ORDER BY` clauses (e.g., `region_id`, `status`, `date_issued`). Composite indexes can be very effective for common query patterns.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Index Scalability):** While initial indexes are defined, their effectiveness can change as data volume grows and query patterns evolve. Plan for periodic review of slow queries and database performance metrics to identify needs for new or modified indexes.
*   **Alembic Best Practices (CRITICAL):** The `--autogenerate` command is powerful but requires careful handling. Follow this checklist to avoid the issues encountered in Phase 01:
    1.  **Import Models:** Before running `autogenerate`, make sure you have imported your new model modules in `alembic/env.py` (e.g., `from fastapi_app.models import contract, esi_type_cache  # noqa: F401`). If you don't, Alembic won't see your new tables and will generate an empty migration.
    2.  **Generate Revision:** Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your descriptive message"`.
    3.  **Inspect the Script:** **ALWAYS** open and review the generated migration file. If it's empty (only has `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` with `pass`), your models were not imported correctly. Delete the empty file and go back to step 1.
    4.  **Check DB Status:** If you get a "Target database is not up to date" error, it means there's a mismatch between the migration files in your `versions` folder and what the database reports. This can happen if a faulty, empty migration was created earlier. To fix it, you may need to find the last *good* migration in the DB, `alembic stamp <good_revision_id>`, manually delete the faulty migration file(s), and then try again.
    5.  **Apply Migration:** Once the script looks correct, run `alembic upgrade head`.
*   **Long-Term Data Management:** While not for MVP, consider that the `Contract` table could grow significantly over time. A future enhancement might involve a data pruning or archival strategy for very old, inactive contracts to manage database size and performance.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Data Lifecycle):** Reiterate the importance of a strategy for handling contracts that may be removed or become permanently unavailable from ESI. Without this, the local database could increasingly diverge or retain stale/irrelevant data.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   SQLAlchemy models for `Contract` and `ContractItem` are defined.
*   Relationships and necessary indexes are included in the models.
*   An Alembic migration script is generated and successfully applied to the database schema.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Potential Challenge 1: Empty Alembic Migration Script**
    *   **Symptom:** Running `alembic revision --autogenerate` produces a new migration file, but the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions are empty (`pass`).
    *   **Root Cause:** The new SQLAlchemy model files (e.g., `contract.py`) were not imported into the scope of `alembic/env.py` before `target_metadata` was defined. Alembic was unaware of the new tables.
    *   **Proactive Resolution:** Add the necessary imports to `alembic/env.py` (e.g., `from fastapi_app.models import contract # noqa: F401`).

*   **Potential Challenge 2: "Target database is not up to date" Error**
    *   **Symptom:** `alembic revision --autogenerate` fails with this error.
    *   **Root Cause:** A previous, possibly faulty or empty, migration script exists in the `alembic/versions` folder that has not been applied to the database, causing a history mismatch.
    *   **Proactive Resolution:** Check the `versions` folder for any unexpected/empty migration files. If found, check the current DB revision with `alembic current`. You may need to manually delete the faulty script and `alembic stamp` the database to the last known good revision before re-generating.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** The data models are for storing public contract data, which is not sensitive. No user-specific or secret data is being modeled in this task.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A for model definition. The services that populate these models will be responsible for validating the incoming ESI data.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A for model definition.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A for model definition.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A for this task.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** SQLAlchemy and Alembic are already managed by PDM.
*   **Notes:** This task has minimal direct security impact as it only defines the shape of public, non-sensitive data.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** N/A for model definition. Observability for data access and manipulation is handled by the services using these models.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** Unit tests are not typically written for declarative SQLAlchemy models themselves.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** The models were tested implicitly through integration tests of the services that perform CRUD operations on them (e.g., background aggregation service). These tests verified that data can be written to and read from the database correctly, and that relationships work as expected.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** N/A for the models directly.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** Test fixtures were used implicitly by the aggregation service tests which populated these models.
*   **Notes:** The primary validation for this task was a successful `alembic upgrade head` and the successful operation of services using these models. Formal testing occurred when the models were used by other components, particularly the background aggregation service.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** N/A. This task defines backend data structures and has no direct user interface or CLI component.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** N/A. This task defines backend data structures. Any user-facing text derived from this data (e.g., item names) is sourced from ESI, which has its own i18n considerations not part of this model definition task.
