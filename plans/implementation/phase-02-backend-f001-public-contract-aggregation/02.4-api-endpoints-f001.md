# Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001

**Phase:** 02 - Backend - F001: Public Contract Aggregation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To develop FastAPI API endpoints that expose the aggregated public contract data and related metadata (like market groups) to the frontend, supporting filtering and pagination as required by F001 and F002.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: API Design Principles, Backend Architecture)
*   `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (API endpoint requirements, filtering parameters)
*   Task 02.2: Data Models for F001 (for response schemas)
*   Task 01.2: Database Setup (for `get_db` dependency)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [X] **Define Pydantic Schemas for API Responses:**
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/schemas/contract.py` and `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/schemas/market.py`.
    *   Define Pydantic models specifically for API responses. These schemas are distinct from SQLAlchemy models and define the public API contract.
    *   **AI Prompt (Contracts):** "Generate Pydantic schemas for F001 contract API responses in `schemas/contract.py`. \n1. `ShipContractRead`: Represents a single ship contract. Include `contract_id`, `ship_type_id`, `ship_name`, `price`, `location_name`, `date_issued`, `title`, `is_blueprint_copy`, `quantity`, `runs`, `material_efficiency`, `time_efficiency`, `contains_additional_items`. \n2. `PaginatedShipContractResponse`: A generic Pydantic schema for pagination, including `items: list[ShipContractRead]`, `total_items: int`, `total_pages: int`, `page: int`, `size: int`."
    *   **AI Prompt (Market Groups):** "Generate a Pydantic schema `MarketGroupRead` in `schemas/market.py`. It should include `market_group_id`, `name`, and `parent_group_id`."

*   [X] **Implement Endpoint 1: List Ship Contracts (`/api/v1/contracts/ships`):**
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/api/v1/endpoints/contracts.py`.
    *   Implement a `GET` endpoint to list ship contracts.
    *   **Query Parameters:** Support validated query parameters for filtering (`region_id: Optional[int]`, `ship_type_id: Optional[int]`) and pagination (`page: int = Query(1, ge=1)`, `size: int = Query(20, ge=1, le=100)`).
    *   **Database Query:** Use SQLAlchemy to query `Contract` where `is_ship_contract == True`, applying filters. The query should join with `EsiTypeCache` to retrieve the `ship_name`.
    *   **Response:** Transform the SQLAlchemy model instances into `ShipContractRead` Pydantic schemas and return them within the `PaginatedShipContractResponse` structure. Default sort should be `date_issued` descending.
    *   **Error Handling:** Use standard FastAPI `HTTPException` for errors. Handle cases where a `ship_name` is missing from the cache gracefully by logging a warning and returning a placeholder value.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a FastAPI GET endpoint `/api/v1/contracts/ships` in `endpoints/contracts.py`. The endpoint should:\n1. Accept query parameters for filtering (`region_id`, `ship_type_id`) and pagination (`page`, `size`).\n2. Depend on an async SQLAlchemy session.\n3. Construct a query for `Contract` objects where `is_ship_contract == True`, joining with `EsiTypeCache` to get `ship_name`.\n4. Apply filters and pagination to the query.\n5. Transform results into `ShipContractRead` schemas and return them in a `PaginatedShipContractResponse`."

*   [X] **Implement Endpoint 2: List Market Groups (`/api/v1/ships/market_groups`):**
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/api/v1/endpoints/ships.py`.
    *   Implement a `GET` endpoint to list all market groups.
    *   **Database Query:** Use SQLAlchemy to query the `EsiMarketGroupCache` table.
    *   **Response:** Transform the results into a `list[MarketGroupRead]` Pydantic schema.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a FastAPI GET endpoint `/api/v1/ships/market_groups` in `endpoints/ships.py`. The endpoint should:\n1. Depend on an async SQLAlchemy session.\n2. Query all records from the `EsiMarketGroupCache` table.\n3. Transform the results into `MarketGroupRead` schemas and return them as a list."

*   [X] **API Router Integration:**
    *   Create an `APIRouter` in each new endpoint file (`contracts.py`, `ships.py`).
    *   Include these routers in a main v1 router in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/api/v1/api.py`.
    *   Mount the main v1 router in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py` under the `/api/v1` prefix.

*   [ ] **(Optional) Implement Single Contract Detail Endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/contracts/{contract_id}`):**
    *   While F003 covers detailed views, a basic endpoint to fetch a single contract by ID might be useful here if F001 display implies clicking for more details not covered by the list view itself. For MVP, this might be deferred to F003 tasks.
    *   **Decision:** Defer to Phase 07 for F003.

*   [X] **Input Validation:**
    *   Rely on FastAPI's automatic validation for query parameters and Pydantic for request bodies (if any).

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use FastAPI's `Depends` for database sessions (`get_db`).
*   Structure API endpoints logically using APIRouters.
*   Ensure Pydantic schemas accurately reflect the data to be exposed to the client.
*   Implement efficient database queries, especially for filtering and pagination.
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Pagination Scalability):** Standard `OFFSET`-based pagination can become inefficient on very large datasets. For future scalability if this endpoint handles millions of records, consider migrating to keyset pagination (cursor-based pagination).
    *   **Pre-mortem Note (Query Complexity/DoS):** While basic validation is in place for pagination parameters, be mindful that complex combinations of other filter parameters could potentially lead to very slow queries. If performance issues arise, analyze slow query logs and consider adding limits to query complexity or more specific indexing.
*   Follow RESTful principles for API design.
*   **Future Consideration (Scalability/Security):** If API usage grows significantly or abuse is detected, consider implementing application-level API rate limiting (e.g., using a library like `slowapi`).
*   **Pre-mortem Note (Cross-Phase Friction):** Maintain very close communication with the frontend development team (Phase 3) regarding the exact structure of API request parameters (filters) and response schemas. Any discrepancies will cause integration delays. Regularly share OpenAPI schema definitions.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Pydantic schemas for API responses are defined.
*   A GET endpoint to list contracts with basic filtering and pagination is implemented and functional.
*   The endpoint is integrated into the FastAPI application via an API router.
*   The API is tested locally (e.g., using Swagger UI or `curl`).
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** Endpoints expose public, non-sensitive data. No authentication is required for these F001 endpoints.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** FastAPI handles basic type validation for query parameters. Pydantic models define response schemas. Explicit validation for query parameter ranges (e.g., `page`, `size`) and allowed values for filters implemented.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** FastAPI handles JSON response encoding, mitigating XSS for API responses.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A for public data endpoints in F001.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A for this task.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** FastAPI and Pydantic are managed by PDM.
*   **Notes:** Pagination parameters (`size`) have a reasonable upper limit (e.g., 100) enforced by FastAPI `Query` validation to prevent abuse.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** Log incoming requests with query parameters.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** Log response status and duration for each API call.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** FastAPI's default exception handling logs errors. Custom error handling also logs appropriately.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** FastAPI/Uvicorn access logs include request identifiers, facilitating correlation.
*   [x] **Metrics:** Track request counts, error rates, and response latencies for these endpoints.
*   **Notes:** `logging.basicConfig()` setup in `main.py` ensures log visibility.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Pydantic schema validation is implicit. Endpoint logic, including data transformation, is tested via integration tests with `TestClient`.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** Used FastAPI's `TestClient` to send requests to the endpoints.
    *   Database dependency (`get_db`) was managed for test sessions with pre-populated data.
    *   Verified successful responses (200 OK), including correct data structure (matching Pydantic schemas) and pagination logic.
    *   Tested filtering logic by providing different query parameters and asserting the results.
    *   Tested error conditions (e.g., invalid query parameters leading to 422 errors).
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** Achieved good coverage of endpoint logic, including different filter combinations and pagination scenarios, through `TestClient` testing.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** Test fixtures were used to populate the test database with `Contract`, `ContractItem`, and `EsiTypeCache` records covering various test cases.
*   **Notes:** `TestClient` was essential for thoroughly testing FastAPI application endpoints.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** N/A. This task implements backend API endpoints.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** N/A. API responses are data-centric (JSON, typically UTF-8 by default from FastAPI); localization is a frontend concern. The API provides raw data.
