# Task 10.3: Final Documentation & README Update

**Phase:** 10 - Deployment
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To finalize all project documentation, including updating the main `README.md` with comprehensive information about the MVP, setup instructions, development guidelines, and links to key design and specification documents.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   All previously created design documents (`design/` folder).
*   All previously created implementation plan documents (`plans/implementation/` folder).
*   `README.md` (existing, to be updated).
*   `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if exists, or create basic version).
*   `LICENSE` (ensure one is chosen and present, e.g., MIT).

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Update `README.md`:**
    *   **Project Overview:**
        *   Brief description of Hangar Bay and its purpose.
        *   Key features included in the MVP (F001, F002, F003).
    *   **Tech Stack:**
        *   List frontend (Angular) and backend (FastAPI, Python, PostgreSQL, Valkey) technologies.
    *   **Getting Started / Setup Instructions:**
        *   Prerequisites (Python version, Node.js version, Docker, etc.).
        *   Backend setup: cloning, virtual environment, installing dependencies (`requirements.txt`), environment variables (`.env` template), running database migrations, running the dev server.
        *   Frontend setup: cloning, installing dependencies (`npm install`), environment variables (`environment.ts`), running the dev server.
        *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a template for 'Getting Started' instructions in a README for a project with a Python/FastAPI backend and an Angular frontend. Include steps for cloning, dependency installation, environment setup, and running dev servers for both."
    *   **Running Tests:**
        *   Instructions for running backend tests (`pytest`).
        *   Instructions for running frontend tests (`ng test`).
    *   **Project Structure Overview:**
        *   Brief explanation of key directories (e.g., `backend/`, `frontend/`, `design/`, `plans/`).
    *   **Links to Key Documents:**
        *   Link to `design/design-spec.md`.
        *   Link to `design/security-spec.md`.
        *   Link to `design/api-design-guide.md` (if exists).
        *   Link to `plans/implementation/00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md`.
    *   **Deployment Info (High-Level):**
        *   Brief mention of how the application is deployed (e.g., "Backend deployed as Docker container, Frontend as static site. CI/CD via GitHub Actions.").
        *   Links to live MVP application (once deployed).
*   [ ] **Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Optional for MVP but good practice):**
    *   If time allows, create a basic `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for code style, PR process, issue reporting.
*   [ ] **Ensure `LICENSE` File:**
    *   Verify a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) is present at the project root.
*   [ ] **Review Inline Code Comments & Docstrings:**
    *   Encourage a quick review of critical code sections for clarity in comments and docstrings. Not a full audit, but a spot check.
*   [ ] **Check All Internal Document Links:**
    *   Verify that links within Markdown documents (e.g., in `design/` and `plans/`) are correct and relative.
*   [ ] **AI Implementation Guidance Sections:**
    *   Ensure all key spec documents and the `README.md` itself have the AI guidance sections (as per Memory [221cf1b4-d350-4de0-aee9-9f4453151e64]).

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   The `README.md` is the entry point for new developers and users. Make it clear, concise, and comprehensive.
*   Provide easy-to-follow setup instructions.
*   Ensure all important project aspects are covered or linked.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   `README.md` is thoroughly updated with all sections listed above.
*   Setup instructions for backend and frontend are clear and tested.
*   Links to key design and plan documents are included and correct.
*   A `LICENSE` file is present.
*   (Optional) Basic `CONTRIBUTING.md` is created or reviewed.
*   Internal documentation links are verified.
*   All documentation changes are committed to version control.
