# Task 10.2: Basic CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Phase:** 10 - Deployment
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To set up a basic Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions (or similar preferred tool) for automating builds, tests, and deployments of the backend and frontend applications for the MVP.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Section: Deployment Strategy, CI/CD)
*   Task 10.1: Deployment Preparation & Packaging (Artifacts to be deployed)
*   Task 09.3: Testing Strategy & Implementation (Tests to be run in CI)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Continuous Integration (CI) - For Both Backend & Frontend
*   [ ] **Choose CI/CD Platform:**
    *   Default to GitHub Actions if no other preference.
*   [ ] **Workflow Definition (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
    *   Trigger on pushes/PRs to `main`/`develop` branches.
*   [ ] **Backend CI Steps:**
    *   Set up Python environment.
    *   Install dependencies (from `requirements.txt`).
    *   Run linters/formatters (e.g., Black, Flake8, Ruff).
    *   Run unit and integration tests (`pytest` - from Task 09.3).
    *   (Optional) Build Docker image (but don't push yet unless it's a merge to `main`).
*   [ ] **Frontend CI Steps:**
    *   Set up Node.js/Angular environment.
    *   Install dependencies (`npm ci`).
    *   Run linters/formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
    *   Run unit tests (`ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless`).
    *   Build the application (`ng build --configuration production`).
*   [ ] **Notifications/Status Checks:**
    *   Ensure CI status (pass/fail) is reported (e.g., on GitHub PRs).

### Continuous Deployment (CD) - For Backend (Example: Docker Hub & Render/Fly.io)
*   [ ] **CD Workflow Definition (e.g., `.github/workflows/cd-backend.yml`):
    *   Trigger on merge to `main` branch (or tag creation).
*   [ ] **Build & Push Docker Image:**
    *   Log in to Docker Hub (or other container registry).
    *   Build the backend Docker image (using Dockerfile from Task 10.1).
    *   Tag the image appropriately (e.g., `latest`, git SHA).
    *   Push the image to Docker Hub.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show a GitHub Actions workflow step to build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub, using secrets for Docker Hub credentials."
*   [ ] **Deploy to Hosting Platform:**
    *   Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Render, Fly.io, DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS/EKS Lite).
    *   Use platform-specific CLI or API to trigger a deployment of the new Docker image.
    *   Handle database migrations as part of the deployment process (e.g., a pre-deploy hook or job).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Illustrate a conceptual GitHub Actions step for deploying a new Docker image to Render, assuming Render CLI is available or using a Render deploy hook URL."
*   [ ] **Secrets Management in CI/CD:**
    *   Store sensitive information (Docker Hub credentials, hosting platform API keys, SSH keys) as encrypted secrets in the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Secrets).

### Continuous Deployment (CD) - For Frontend (Example: Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages)
*   [ ] **CD Workflow Definition (e.g., `.github/workflows/cd-frontend.yml`):
    *   Trigger on merge to `main` branch.
*   [ ] **Deploy Static Assets:**
    *   Choose a static hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3+CloudFront).
    *   Use platform-specific CLI or GitHub Action to deploy the `dist/` folder (from `ng build`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show a GitHub Actions workflow step to deploy an Angular application's `dist` folder to Netlify using the Netlify CLI or a dedicated Netlify action."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Start with a simple pipeline and iterate.
*   Ensure secrets are handled securely.
*   Make sure tests are reliably run before any deployment.
*   Choose deployment targets that are easy to manage for MVP.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   CI pipelines for backend and frontend are set up and functional on GitHub Actions (or chosen platform).
    *   Pipelines trigger on relevant events (pushes/PRs).
    *   Linters, formatters, and tests are run automatically.
    *   Builds are performed.
*   Basic CD pipelines for backend and frontend are set up.
    *   Backend: Docker image is built and pushed to a registry; deployment to a hosting platform is automated on merge to `main`.
    *   Frontend: Static assets are deployed to a hosting platform on merge to `main`.
*   Secrets required for CI/CD are securely stored and accessed.
*   CI/CD status is visible (e.g., on PRs).
*   All workflow files are committed to version control.
