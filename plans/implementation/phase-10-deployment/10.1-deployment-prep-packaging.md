# Task 10.1: Deployment Preparation & Packaging

**Phase:** 10 - Deployment
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To prepare the backend and frontend applications for deployment, including final configuration checks, build processes, and packaging into deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker images for the backend).

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Deployment Strategy, Backend Architecture, Frontend Architecture)
*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Considerations for production environments)
*   Task 00.2: Environment Configuration (Ensuring production configs are ready)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Backend (FastAPI)
*   [ ] **Production Configuration Review:**
    *   Verify `prod.env` (or equivalent mechanism) has all necessary settings:
        *   `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the production PostgreSQL instance.
        *   `VALKEY_URL` pointing to the production Valkey instance.
        *   `ESI_CLIENT_ID`, `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET` (if applicable for public data, or for future auth).
        *   `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` (or appropriate for production).
        *   `SECRET_KEY` for any cryptographic operations (ensure it's strong and unique).
    *   Ensure no debug flags are enabled for production.
*   [ ] **Dockerfile Finalization:**
    *   Review and finalize the `Dockerfile` (from Task 00.1) for building the production backend image.
    *   Ensure it uses a minimal base image.
    *   Ensure it copies only necessary files.
    *   Optimize for layer caching.
    *   Run as a non-root user.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Review a Python FastAPI Dockerfile for production. Key considerations: multi-stage builds, non-root user, efficient dependency installation, and copying only necessary application code."
*   [ ] **Database Migrations:**
    *   Ensure all Alembic migrations (from Task 01.2 and subsequent model changes) are up-to-date and tested.
    *   Plan how migrations will be run against the production database (often as a step before deploying the new application version).
*   [ ] **Dependency Freezing:**
    *   Ensure `requirements.txt` (or `poetry.lock` / `Pipfile.lock`) accurately reflects all production dependencies with pinned versions.

### Frontend (Angular)
*   [ ] **Production Configuration (`environment.prod.ts`):**
    *   Verify `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` has:
        *   `production: true`.
        *   `apiUrl` pointing to the production backend API URL.
*   [ ] **Build Optimization:**
    *   Build the Angular application for production: `ng build --configuration production`.
    *   This enables optimizations like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, minification, and tree-shaking.
*   [ ] **Static Asset Preparation:**
    *   The output of `ng build` (typically in the `dist/` folder) contains the static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) to be deployed.
*   [ ] **Base HREF (if needed):**
    *   If deploying to a subdirectory, ensure `<base href="...">` in `index.html` is correctly configured or handled by the build process/deployment environment.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Focus on creating lean, secure, and configurable deployable artifacts.
*   Double-check all environment-specific configurations.
*   Follow Docker best practices for creating production-ready images.
*   Ensure the Angular build process uses production optimizations.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend: Production configurations reviewed and finalized. Dockerfile optimized and tested. Database migration strategy confirmed. Dependencies are frozen.
*   Frontend: Production environment configuration (`environment.prod.ts`) verified. Application successfully builds with production optimizations (`ng build --configuration production`). Static assets are ready for deployment.
*   Deployment checklists (if any) are reviewed.
*   All necessary configuration files and build scripts are committed to version control.
