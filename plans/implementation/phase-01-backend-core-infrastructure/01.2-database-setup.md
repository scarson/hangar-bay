# Task 01.2: Database Setup

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

## 1. Objective

To set up the PostgreSQL database for production/staging, configure SQLite for local development, initialize SQLAlchemy ORM, and set up Alembic for database migrations.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Data Tier, Technology Stack)
*   `/design/specifications/security-spec.md` (Sections: Data Security, Secrets Management for DB credentials)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for `DATABASE_URL`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [x] **SQLAlchemy Integration:**
    *   Created `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/db.py`.
    *   Defined asynchronous SQLAlchemy engine, `AsyncSessionLocal`, and `Base` for declarative models.
    *   **Notes:**
        *   Implemented using asynchronous SQLAlchemy with `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL and `aiosqlite` for SQLite (added to `requirements.txt`).
        *   `fastapi_app/config.py` was updated to dynamically generate `DATABASE_URL` using a Pydantic `@computed_field`. This resolved an initial `ValidationError` with Pydantic trying to validate an empty string for `DATABASE_URL` before its value was determined.
        *   For SQLite, `pydantic.networks.AnyUrl` is used as the type hint for the DSN, as `SqliteDsn` is not directly importable from `pydantic.networks` in the used Pydantic version. The DSN string `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./hangar_bay_dev.db` is constructed directly.
*   [x] **Alembic Initialization:**
    *   Initialized Alembic in `app/backend/src/alembic`.
    *   `alembic.ini`: `sqlalchemy.url` commented out as `env.py` provides it dynamically.
    *   `alembic/env.py` modified to:
        *   Point `target_metadata` to `fastapi_app.db.Base.metadata` for autogenerate.
        *   Use `DATABASE_URL` from `fastapi_app.config.get_settings()`.
        *   Support asynchronous operations for online migrations.
    *   **Notes:**
        *   A separate `AsyncEngine` with `poolclass=pool.NullPool` is created within `env.py` for Alembic's online migrations. This ensures isolation from the application's main engine and uses a connection pool strategy suitable for migration tasks.
*   [x] **User Model Definition and Migration:**
    *   Defined the `User` model in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/models/common_models.py`.
        *   Key fields include `id` (PK), `username` (unique), `email` (unique), `hashed_password` (nullable), `is_active` (default True), `eve_character_id` (nullable, unique).
        *   Added `user_type` (SQLAlchemy Enum based on Python `UserType` enum: `EVE_SSO`, `LOCAL`), non-nullable.
        *   Added `is_admin` (Boolean, default False, non-nullable) and `is_test_user` (Boolean, default False, non-nullable).
    *   An initial empty migration (`c74c05fbe554_initial_empty_migration.py`) was created and applied to set up the Alembic version table.
    *   Subsequently, generated the Alembic migration script `baa67b53c016_create_users_table_with_account_types_.py` for the `User` table. This involved troubleshooting (detailed in "Challenges & Resolutions", Sec 6).
    *   Applied the `User` table migration: `alembic upgrade head`.
    *   **Notes:**
        *   The `User` model design choices (nullable fields, `user_type` enum, boolean flags) are further detailed in `design/design-log.md` and the "Challenges & Resolutions" section (Sec 6).
        *   The `aiosqlite` `ModuleNotFoundError` during initial Alembic setup was resolved by ensuring `requirements.txt` was installed in the correct venv. This remains a relevant note for initial environment setup.
*   [x] **Development Database (SQLite):**
    *   Pydantic settings in `fastapi_app/config.py` default to `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./hangar_bay_dev.db` (creating `hangar_bay_dev.db` in `app/backend/src/`) if PostgreSQL environment variables are not set.
    *   `.gitignore` already includes `*.sqlite3` and `*.db`.
*   [x] **Database Connection Functionality:**
    *   Asynchronous `get_db()` dependency function implemented in `fastapi_app/db.py`. This function provides an `AsyncSession` and ensures the session is committed on success, rolled back on error, and closed after the request.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Ensure database credentials are not hardcoded and are managed via environment variables (Pydantic settings).
*   Alembic setup is crucial for schema evolution; ensure `env.py` correctly targets the models' metadata.
*   The local SQLite setup should be seamless for developers.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   SQLAlchemy engine, `SessionLocal`, and `Base` are configured.
*   Alembic is initialized and configured to use the application's settings and metadata.
*   An initial Alembic migration is created and applied.
*   Local development can use SQLite as a fallback.
*   A DB session dependency (`get_db`) is available.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

This task involved significant iterative refinement of the `User` model and troubleshooting of the Alembic migration process.

### 6.1. User Model Design Evolution

The `User` model in `fastapi_app/models/common_models.py` underwent several design iterations:
*   **Initial Concept:** Support both EVE SSO and local users. Key fields `hashed_password` and `eve_character_id` were made nullable to accommodate either authentication type.
*   **Refinement 1 - Explicit Account Type:** To clearly distinguish account origins, a `user_type` column was added using a Python `enum.Enum` (`UserType`) with values `EVE_SSO` and `LOCAL`. This was preferred over more complex solutions like table inheritance for simplicity in this project's context.
*   **Refinement 2 - Decoupling Authorization:** Boolean flags `is_admin` and `is_test_user` were added. This decouples administrative privileges and test user status from the `user_type`, allowing for more flexible user roles (e.g., a `LOCAL` user can be an admin, an `EVE_SSO` user could potentially be flagged as a test user).
*   **Rationale:** This iterative design aims for a clear separation of concerns: account origin (`user_type`), authentication details (nullable `hashed_password`, `eve_character_id`), and authorization/special flags (`is_admin`, `is_test_user`). This approach enhances clarity, maintainability, and flexibility for future authentication and authorization logic.
*   **Documentation:** These design decisions and their rationale were logged in `design/specifications/design-log.md` (Entry: "User Model: Nullable Fields, UserType Enum, and Authorization Flags").

### 6.2. Alembic Autogenerate Troubleshooting

Generating the Alembic migration for the `User` table involved several challenges:

*   **Challenge 1: Initial Empty Migration Script**
    *   **Symptom:** `alembic revision --autogenerate` produced an empty migration script (e.g., `0e0f7e307d35_...`), failing to detect the new `User` table.
    *   **Cause:** The `User` model, defined in `fastapi_app/models/common_models.py`, was not being imported into the `alembic/env.py` script's scope before `target_metadata = Base.metadata` was assigned. Consequently, `Base.metadata` was empty from Alembic's perspective.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `from fastapi_app.models import common_models  # noqa: F401` to `alembic/env.py` to ensure the `User` model (and others) are registered with `Base.metadata`. The `# noqa: F401` comment prevents linters from flagging it as an unused import, as its side effect of model registration is the intended purpose.
    *   **Learning for Cascade/Future Reference:** When `alembic revision --autogenerate` produces an empty script for new or modified tables, the primary suspect is missing model imports in `alembic/env.py` *before* `target_metadata = Base.metadata` (or equivalent) is assigned. Ensure all relevant model modules are imported so that `Base` (or your declarative base) is aware of all tables.

*   **Challenge 2: Persistent "Target database is not up to date" Error**
    *   **Symptom:** After fixing `env.py`, `alembic revision --autogenerate` repeatedly failed with "FAILED: Target database is not up to date."
    *   **Cause:** This error indicates a mismatch between the database's recorded migration version (in the `alembic_version` table) and the sequence of migration files present in the `alembic/versions/` directory. The previously generated empty (and faulty) migration script (`0e0f7e307d35_...`) was confusing Alembic's state detection. Alembic expects the database to be upgraded to the "head" of all known migration scripts before it can compare models to that head state to generate a new revision.
    *   **Resolution Steps (Iterative):**
        1.  An `alembic upgrade head` attempt incorrectly applied the empty `0e0f7e307d35_...` migration.
        2.  Rolled back this application using `alembic downgrade -1`, which reverted the database version to the previous one (`c74c05fbe554_initial_empty_migration.py`).
        3.  To ensure a clean state, explicitly stamped the database to the last known good revision: `alembic stamp c74c05fbe554`.
        4.  **Crucially, the faulty migration file (`0e0f7e307d35_create_users_table_with_account_types_.py`) was manually deleted by the USER from the `app/backend/src/alembic/versions/` directory.** This removed it from Alembic's awareness.
        5.  With the database stamped correctly and the faulty script removed, `alembic revision -m "Create users table with account types and authorization flags" --autogenerate` successfully generated the correct migration script (`baa67b53c016_...`).
    *   **Learning for Cascade/Future Reference:** If "Target database is not up to date" errors persist during `autogenerate` despite `env.py` being correct:
        *   Verify no errant/empty migration scripts exist in the `versions/` folder that are ahead of the database's actual current revision.
        *   If such scripts exist, ensure the database is downgraded to the revision *before* the faulty script(s).
        *   Stamp the database to this last known good revision (`alembic stamp <revision_id>`).
        *   **Manually delete (or request USER to delete) the .py files of any faulty/empty migration scripts from the `alembic/versions/` directory.**
        *   Then, re-attempt `alembic revision --autogenerate`.

### 6.3. General Alembic Configuration Notes
*   The `alembic.ini` setting `prepend_sys_path = .` (when running Alembic from the `app/backend/src/` directory) is vital. It allows `env.py` to correctly import application modules (e.g., `from fastapi_app.config import get_settings`). Without this, `env.py` might fail to find project modules.
*   Using a separate `AsyncEngine` with `poolclass=pool.NullPool` in `env.py` for Alembic's online migrations is a good practice for isolating migration operations.
*   **Initial Setup Note:** During early setup, an `aiosqlite ModuleNotFoundError` was encountered when running Alembic commands. This was resolved by ensuring `pdm install` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`) had been run in the correct virtual environment where Alembic commands were being executed. This is a common pitfall in new environments.


## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** The `User` model design considered separation of EVE SSO and local user types. Nullable `hashed_password` for EVE SSO users (no local password stored) and presence of `eve_character_id` align with principles of minimizing sensitive data storage. Explicit `is_admin` flag supports least privilege.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A for this task (model definition and migration). Input validation will be critical for API endpoints that create or modify `User` entities.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A for this task.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** The `User` model fields (`user_type`, `is_admin`, `hashed_password`, `is_active`) are foundational components for future authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** Database connection URL (`DATABASE_URL`) is managed via Pydantic settings, sourced from environment variables. This adheres to `design/security-spec.md#1.4` by avoiding hardcoded credentials.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** Project dependencies (SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pydantic, etc.) are listed in `app/backend/requirements.txt`. Versions are expected to be pinned as per project policy (Memory `4b806f4d-8600-46c6-b939-f373f67f3c50`).
*   **Notes:** The primary security focus of this task was establishing a secure foundation for user data storage and ensuring database credentials are handled safely according to defined project policies. The `User` model itself provides the necessary fields to implement robust authentication and authorization logic in subsequent tasks.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A for this task directly. Future tasks will implement structured logging for application events.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** Alembic itself logs the execution of migrations (start, end, success/failure) to standard output/console. These are key events for schema changes.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Alembic logs errors encountered during migration attempts to standard output/console.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A for database migration tasks.
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A for database migration tasks.
*   **Notes:** Observability for this task is primarily through Alembic's console output during migration generation and application. No custom application-level observability features were added. Future application interactions with the database will require more detailed observability.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** N/A for SQLAlchemy model definitions or Alembic configuration/migration scripts themselves.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** N/A for this task. Integration tests will be vital for API endpoints that interact with the database and `User` model.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** N/A.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** The setup supports SQLite (`hangar_bay_dev.db`) for local development and testing, configured via Pydantic settings if PostgreSQL env vars are not present. `.env.example` provides a template for environment configurations. The `User` model includes `is_test_user` flag for identifying test-specific user data.
*   **Notes:** Testing for this task involved manually verifying the successful application of the Alembic migration and inspecting the generated migration script. Automated tests will cover database interactions in subsequent tasks.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A (Backend task)
*   **Notes:** This is a backend-only database setup task. Accessibility concerns are not directly applicable.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** N/A. The `UserType` enum values (`EVE_SSO`, `LOCAL`) are internal system identifiers and not directly exposed as user-facing text that would require translation in this task.
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A.
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A (Backend task).
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Database and connection are expected to use UTF-8 (standard for PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy defaults). Pydantic settings are loaded with `env_file_encoding="utf-8"`.
*   **Notes:** This is a backend-only database setup task. No user-facing text requiring i18n was handled.
