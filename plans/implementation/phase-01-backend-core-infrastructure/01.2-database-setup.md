# Task 01.2: Database Setup

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To set up the PostgreSQL database for production/staging, configure SQLite for local development, initialize SQLAlchemy ORM, and set up Alembic for database migrations.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Data Tier, Technology Stack)
*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Sections: Data Security, Secrets Management for DB credentials)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for `DATABASE_URL`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **SQLAlchemy Integration:**
    *   Create `app/core/db.py` (or similar).
    *   Define SQLAlchemy engine using `DATABASE_URL` from Pydantic settings.
    *   Define `SessionLocal` for creating database sessions.
    *   Define a `Base` for declarative models.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate Python code for `db.py` to set up SQLAlchemy engine, `SessionLocal`, and `Base` using a `DATABASE_URL` from Pydantic settings."
*   [ ] **Alembic Initialization:**
    *   Initialize Alembic in the backend project: `alembic init alembic`.
    *   Configure `alembic.ini` to use the `DATABASE_URL` from Pydantic settings.
    *   Modify `env.py` to:
        *   Point to the SQLAlchemy `Base.metadata` for autogenerate.
        *   Use the application's logger configuration if possible.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to configure Alembic's `env.py` to use the application's SQLAlchemy `Base.metadata` and connect using the `DATABASE_URL` from Pydantic settings."
*   [ ] **Initial Migration:**
    *   Create an initial (empty) migration: `alembic revision -m "Initial database setup"`.
    *   Apply the migration: `alembic upgrade head`.
*   [ ] **Development Database (SQLite):**
    *   Ensure the Pydantic settings can default to a SQLite DSN if `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL is not set (e.g., `sqlite:///./hangar_bay_dev.db`).
    *   Add `*.sqlite3` to `.gitignore` (done in Task 00.1, verify).
*   [ ] **Database Connection Functionality:**
    *   Implement a dependency or utility function to get a DB session for use in API endpoints (e.g., `def get_db(): ...`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a FastAPI dependency function `get_db()` that provides a SQLAlchemy session and ensures it's closed after the request."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Ensure database credentials are not hardcoded and are managed via environment variables (Pydantic settings).
*   Alembic setup is crucial for schema evolution; ensure `env.py` correctly targets the models' metadata.
*   The local SQLite setup should be seamless for developers.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   SQLAlchemy engine, `SessionLocal`, and `Base` are configured.
*   Alembic is initialized and configured to use the application's settings and metadata.
*   An initial Alembic migration is created and applied.
*   Local development can use SQLite as a fallback.
*   A DB session dependency (`get_db`) is available.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
