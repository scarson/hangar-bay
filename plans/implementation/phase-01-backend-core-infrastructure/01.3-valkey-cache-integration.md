# Task 01.3: Valkey Caching Layer Integration

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To integrate Valkey (or a compatible Redis client) as a caching layer for the backend application, configure its connection, and provide a basic utility or dependency for accessing the cache.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Caching Strategy, Technology Stack)
*   `../../../design/performance-spec.md` (General caching benefits)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for `CACHE_URL`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Valkey/Redis Client Installation:**
    *   Ensure `valkey` (or `redis-py` if using Redis client for Valkey) is in `requirements.txt` (added in Task 00.1, verify).
*   [ ] **Cache Connection Setup:**
    *   Create `app/core/cache.py` (or similar).
    *   Initialize a Valkey/Redis client instance using the `CACHE_URL` from Pydantic settings.
    *   Implement a simple connection test or health check for the cache.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate Python code for `cache.py` to initialize a Valkey/Redis client using a `CACHE_URL` from Pydantic settings. Include a function to test the connection (e.g., by PINGing the server)."
*   [ ] **Cache Dependency/Utility:**
    *   Provide a FastAPI dependency or a utility function to get the cache client instance for use in services or API endpoints.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a FastAPI dependency function `get_cache()` that provides a Valkey/Redis client instance."
*   [ ] **Basic Cache Usage (Example/Test):**
    *   (Optional, for testing) Implement a temporary test endpoint or a unit test that sets and gets a value from the cache to verify connectivity.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Ensure the cache connection URL is managed via Pydantic settings.
*   The client should handle connection pooling if applicable by default.
*   Consider graceful handling if the cache server is unavailable, though for MVP, failing might be acceptable initially.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Valkey/Redis client is configured and connects to the server using settings from Pydantic.
*   A utility or dependency is available to access the cache client.
*   Basic cache operation (e.g., PING, or set/get for testing) is confirmed to be working.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
