# Task 01.3: Valkey Caching Layer Integration

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To integrate Valkey (or a compatible Redis client) as a caching layer for the backend application, configure its connection, and provide a basic utility or dependency for accessing the cache.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Caching Strategy, Technology Stack)
*   `../../../design/performance-spec.md` (General caching benefits)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for `CACHE_URL`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Valkey/Redis Client Installation:**
    *   Ensure `valkey` (or `redis-py` if using Redis client for Valkey) is in `requirements.txt` (added in Task 00.1, verify).
*   [ ] **Cache Connection Setup:**
    *   Create `app/core/cache.py` (or similar).
    *   Initialize a Valkey/Redis client instance using the `CACHE_URL` from Pydantic settings.
    *   Implement a simple connection test or health check for the cache.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate Python code for `cache.py` to initialize a Valkey/Redis client using a `CACHE_URL` from Pydantic settings. Include a function to test the connection (e.g., by PINGing the server)."
*   [ ] **Cache Dependency/Utility:**
    *   Provide a FastAPI dependency or a utility function to get the cache client instance for use in services or API endpoints.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a FastAPI dependency function `get_cache()` that provides a Valkey/Redis client instance."
*   [ ] **Basic Cache Usage (Example/Test):**
    *   (Optional, for testing) Implement a temporary test endpoint or a unit test that sets and gets a value from the cache to verify connectivity.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Ensure the cache connection URL is managed via Pydantic settings.
*   The client should handle connection pooling if applicable by default.
*   Consider graceful handling if the cache server is unavailable, though for MVP, failing might be acceptable initially.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Valkey/Redis client is configured and connects to the server using settings from Pydantic.
*   A utility or dependency is available to access the cache client.
*   Basic cache operation (e.g., PING, or set/get for testing) is confirmed to be working.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
