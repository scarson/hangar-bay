# Task 01.3: Valkey Caching Layer Integration

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

## 1. Objective

To integrate Valkey (or a compatible Redis client) as a caching layer for the backend application, configure its connection, and provide a basic utility or dependency for accessing the cache.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Caching Strategy, Technology Stack)
*   `/design/specifications/performance-spec.md` (General caching benefits)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for `CACHE_URL`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [x] **Redis Client Installation (Async):**
    *   Use PDM to add the `redis` library with `aioredis` extras for asynchronous support: `pdm add "redis[aioredis]"`.
    *   Verify that `redis` is listed as a dependency in `app/backend/pyproject.toml` and that `app/backend/pdm.lock` is updated.
*   [x] **Cache Connection Setup:**
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/core/cache.py`.
    *   Initialize an asynchronous Redis client instance (e.g., `redis.asyncio.from_url`) using the `CACHE_URL` from Pydantic settings (defined in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/config.py`).
    *   Implement an async function to test the connection (e.g., by PINGing the server).
    *   Integrate cache client initialization (e.g., creating a connection pool) and closing into the FastAPI application lifecycle events (startup/shutdown) in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py`. The client instance could be stored on `app.state` for access.
    *   **AI Prompt for `cache.py`:** "Generate Python code for `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/core/cache.py` to define a class or functions for managing an asynchronous Redis client. It should include a way to get the client instance (which will be initialized at app startup)."
    *   **AI Prompt for `main.py` lifecycle:** "Show how to modify `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py` to initialize the async Redis client (defined in `fastapi_app.core.cache`) on application startup, store it (e.g., on `app.state.redis`), and properly close its connection pool on application shutdown. Ensure the `CACHE_URL` is retrieved from the app's Pydantic settings."
    *   [x] Replace `print` statements in `cache.py` with proper `logging` calls.
*   [x] **Cache Dependency/Utility:**
    *   Provide an async FastAPI dependency (e.g., `async def get_cache(request: Request) -> redis.asyncio.Redis: return request.app.state.redis`) to get the Redis client instance for use in services or API endpoints.
    *   **AI Prompt for dependency:** "Generate an async FastAPI dependency function `get_cache(request: Request)` that retrieves the initialized asynchronous Redis client instance (e.g., from `request.app.state.redis`)."
*   [x] **Basic Cache Usage (Development Test Endpoint):**
    *   Reinstated the temporary `/cache-test` endpoint in `main.py` for convenient manual verification of cache connectivity and basic set/get operations during ongoing MVP development. This endpoint is tagged for "Development/Test" in OpenAPI and includes basic error logging.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Ensure the cache connection URL (`CACHE_URL`) is added to and managed via Pydantic settings in `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/config.py`.
*   The `redis.asyncio` client handles connection pooling by default when created with `from_url`.
*   Consider graceful handling if the cache server is unavailable (e.g., log error, return None or fallback data). For MVP, failing on connection issues during startup or critical operations might be acceptable initially, but should be logged clearly.
*   **Logging Verification (CRITICAL REMINDER):** When adding logging to new modules in a FastAPI/Uvicorn project (or similar Python applications), if log messages are not appearing in the console as expected, **ALWAYS verify that a basic root logger configuration (e.g., `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='YOUR_CHOSEN_FORMAT')` in `main.py` or the application entry point) is in place.** Do not assume the web server's (e.g., Uvicorn) default logging setup will automatically capture and display all desired logs from custom modules without this explicit base configuration for the Python `logging` system.
*   **Temporary Test Utilities:** If implementing temporary test endpoints or utilities, clearly communicate their purpose. Before removal, explicitly confirm with the USER if they have served all validation needs and if there's any benefit to keeping them for a short period for ongoing development convenience. If kept, mark as technical debt and for development use only (e.g., via comments like "# CASCADE-PROD-CHECK: Remove or disable this endpoint for production." and OpenAPI tags).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Asynchronous Redis client (`redis.asyncio`) is configured and connects to the Valkey/Redis server using settings from Pydantic.
*   An async FastAPI dependency is available to access the Redis client instance.
*   Basic cache operation (e.g., PING, or set/get for testing) is confirmed to be working.
*   Basic logging is implemented for cache connection events (success, errors, closure).
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
*   A temporary `/cache-test` endpoint is available in `main.py` for manual verification of cache functionality during development.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Logging Visibility:** Initial attempts to verify logging from `cache.py` were unsuccessful as messages did not appear in the Uvicorn console after replacing `print` statements.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(levelname)s:     %(name)s - %(message)s')` to `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py`. This established a baseline configuration for the root logger, enabling log messages from custom modules like `cache.py` to be processed and displayed in the Uvicorn console. This step is crucial for ensuring log visibility in Python applications run with servers like Uvicorn.
*   **Test Endpoint Management:** The temporary `/cache-test` endpoint was initially removed after basic verification, leading to some confusion when further validation was attempted.
    *   **Resolution:** Reinstated the `/cache-test` endpoint upon USER request for ongoing development convenience, with added OpenAPI tagging and minor improvements (key expiry, error logging). It is understood that this endpoint is temporary and should be removed or replaced by automated tests before any production-like deployment.
*   **Technical Debt/Follow-up:**
    *   The `/cache-test` endpoint in `main.py` should be removed once comprehensive automated integration tests for cache-dependent features are in place, or before any production-like deployment.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** The `CACHE_URL` is managed via Pydantic settings, sourced from environment variables, aligning with secrets management best practices. The temporary `/cache-test` endpoint is for development convenience and is marked for removal/disabling in production; it does not expose sensitive operations or data beyond test key/values. No other direct security implications for this specific infrastructure task beyond standard dependency management (covered by PDM and regular updates).

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [x] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** Replaced print statements in `cache.py` with `logging` for connection success/closure, errors (with `exc_info=True`), and critical failures during initialization. A baseline application log format (`%(levelname)s:     %(name)s - %(message)s`) was established in `main.py` via `logging.basicConfig()` to improve readability and consistency with Uvicorn's output (see `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md` for details). Structured logging (e.g., JSON) remains a future enhancement for more advanced observability.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** Formal automated unit or integration tests specifically for direct cache connectivity (e.g., creating a `test_cache.py`) have been deferred for this task. Manual verification of cache functionality is available via the temporarily reinstated `/cache-test` endpoint in `main.py`. Cache functionality will be implicitly tested via integration tests for features that utilize the cache as they are developed.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
