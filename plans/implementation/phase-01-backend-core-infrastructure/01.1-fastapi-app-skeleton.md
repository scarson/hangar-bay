# Task 01.1: FastAPI Application Skeleton

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To create the basic directory structure and initial files for the FastAPI backend application, including a main application instance, a simple health check endpoint, and integration with the Pydantic settings established in Phase 0.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Technology Stack, Backend Architecture, API Design Principles)
*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Initial considerations for API security)
*   `../../../design/observability-spec.md` (Initial thoughts on logging setup)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for Pydantic settings)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Create Backend Application Directory:**
    *   Ensure the main backend source directory `app/backend/src/` and the FastAPI application package directory `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/` exist. These will house all backend Python code.
*   [ ] **Initialize `main.py` and `config.py`:**
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py`.
        *   Instantiate the FastAPI app: `app = FastAPI()`.
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/config.py` for Pydantic settings (as per Task 00.2 and finalized directory structure).
        *   Ensure `main.py` imports and initializes Pydantic settings from `config.py`.
*   [ ] **Health Check Endpoint:**
    *   Implement a simple GET `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK response (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a basic FastAPI GET endpoint at `/health` that returns `{"status": "ok"}`."
*   [ ] **Basic Project Structure:**
    *   Create subdirectories within `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/` for future modules: `routers/` (for API routers), `models/` (for Pydantic/SQLAlchemy models), `services/` (for business logic). Each should contain an `__init__.py` file.
*   [ ] **Update `uvicorn` command:**
    *   Ensure `uvicorn` can run the app. From the `app/backend/src/` directory, the command would be `uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload`. Document this command and the required CWD in the backend's README or a project setup guide.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Follow FastAPI best practices for application structure.
*   Ensure the Pydantic settings are loaded correctly at startup.
*   The health check endpoint should be simple and require no authentication.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   The basic FastAPI application structure is in place.
*   `app/main.py` initializes FastAPI and loads configuration.
*   A functional `/health` endpoint is implemented and tested locally.
*   The application can be run using `uvicorn`.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 6.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 6.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 6.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
