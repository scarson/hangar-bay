# Task 01.1: FastAPI Application Skeleton

**Phase:** 01 - Backend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

## 1. Objective

To create the basic directory structure and initial files for the FastAPI backend application, including a main application instance, a simple health check endpoint, and integration with the Pydantic settings established in Phase 0.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Technology Stack, Backend Architecture, API Design Principles)
*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Initial considerations for API security)
*   `../../../design/observability-spec.md` (Initial thoughts on logging setup)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (for Pydantic settings)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Create Backend Application Directory:**
    *   Ensure the main backend source directory `app/backend/src/` and the FastAPI application package directory `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/` exist. These will house all backend Python code.
*   [ ] **Initialize `main.py` and `config.py`:**
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/main.py`.
        *   Instantiate the FastAPI app: `app = FastAPI()`.
    *   Create `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/config.py` for Pydantic settings (as per Task 00.2 and finalized directory structure).
        *   Ensure `main.py` imports and initializes Pydantic settings from `config.py`.
*   [ ] **Health Check Endpoint:**
    *   Implement a simple GET `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK response (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a basic FastAPI GET endpoint at `/health` that returns `{"status": "ok"}`."
*   [ ] **Basic Project Structure:**
    *   Create subdirectories within `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/` for future modules: `routers/` (for API routers), `models/` (for Pydantic/SQLAlchemy models), `services/` (for business logic). Each should contain an `__init__.py` file.
*   [ ] **Update `uvicorn` command:**
    *   Ensure `uvicorn` can run the app. From the `app/backend/src/` directory, the command would be `uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload`. Document this command and the required CWD in the backend's README or a project setup guide.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Follow FastAPI best practices for application structure.
*   Ensure the Pydantic settings are loaded correctly at startup.
*   The health check endpoint should be simple and require no authentication.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   The basic FastAPI application structure is in place.
*   `app/main.py` initializes FastAPI and loads configuration.
*   A functional `/health` endpoint is implemented and tested locally.
*   The application can be run using `uvicorn`.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
*   Python import conflict (due to application package named `fastapi`) resolved by renaming to `fastapi_app`, enabling successful Uvicorn execution.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Challenge:** Initial attempts to run the application using `uvicorn fastapi.main:app --reload` failed with an `ImportError`. The root cause was that the local application package directory was named `app/backend/src/fastapi/`, which shadowed the installed `fastapi` library. This prevented the `from fastapi import FastAPI` statement in `main.py` from correctly importing the library's `FastAPI` class.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   The backend application package directory was renamed from `app/backend/src/fastapi/` to `app/backend/src/fastapi_app/`.
    *   The `uvicorn` command was updated to `\hangar-bay\app\backend\.venv\Scripts\uvicorn.exe fastapi_app.main:app --reload --port 8000` (when run from `app/backend/src/`).
    *   All relevant documentation (this task plan, design log, progress plan) was updated to reflect the new `fastapi_app` naming.
    *   This change successfully resolved the import conflict, allowing the FastAPI application to start and operate as expected.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** Basic API structure established. No sensitive operations implemented yet. Future tasks will incorporate specific security measures (auth, input validation for actual endpoints). The use of Pydantic for settings provides a foundation for typed configurations.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** Not applicable for the `/health` endpoint as it takes no input. Pydantic settings provide validation for configuration values.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** Not applicable for the `/health` endpoint's simple JSON response. FastAPI handles JSON encoding by default.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** Not applicable for the `/health` endpoint.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** Pydantic settings load from `.env` file, which is gitignored. `ESI_CLIENT_ID` and `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET` are defined in `config.py` but are empty strings by default, to be populated via `.env`. This aligns with `security-spec.md#1.4`.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** `requirements.txt` pins versions for `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic-settings`, `python-dotenv`. Other dependencies (asyncpg, redis, SQLAlchemy, alembic) are also pinned. This aligns with `MEMORY[4b806f4d-8600-46c6-b939-f373f67f3c50]`.
*   **Notes:** This task establishes the foundational structure. Security for actual API endpoints (F001 onwards) will be a key focus in subsequent tasks, including input validation, authentication, and authorization. The current `/health` endpoint is public and benign.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** Not explicitly implemented in `main.py` yet. FastAPI and Uvicorn provide basic request/response logging. `LOG_LEVEL` is configurable via Pydantic settings.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** Uvicorn logs server start/stop and request handling. No custom application-level events logged in this skeleton.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Uvicorn and FastAPI handle basic error logging. No custom error logging implemented yet.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** Not implemented in this basic skeleton.
*   [ ] **Metrics:** Not implemented in this basic skeleton.
*   **Notes:** Observability is currently reliant on Uvicorn's default logging. Task `01.4 Logging and Monitoring Setup` will address structured logging, correlation IDs, and metrics integration more comprehensively as per `observability-spec.md`. The `LOG_LEVEL` setting in `config.py` provides a hook for future enhancements.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** No new specific business logic was added that would require unit tests beyond what FastAPI provides for its core functionality. The `/health` endpoint is trivial.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** Not implemented for this skeleton. Future tasks involving database or external service interaction will require integration tests.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** N/A for this task.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** `.env.example` (from Task 00.2) provides a template for environment-specific configurations, which includes test environment considerations.
*   **Notes:** Testing for this task was primarily manual verification (running `uvicorn`, checking `/health` endpoint). Formal unit/integration tests will be introduced as more complex logic and components are added, adhering to `test-spec.md`.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A (Backend task)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A (Backend task)
*   **Notes:** This is a backend-only task. Accessibility concerns are not directly applicable to the API skeleton itself, beyond ensuring standard error responses if applicable (which FastAPI handles).

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** N/A (No user-facing text in API responses for `/health`).
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A.
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A (Backend task).
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Pydantic settings are loaded with `env_file_encoding="utf-8"`. FastAPI defaults to UTF-8 for responses.
*   **Notes:** This is a backend-only task. The `/health` endpoint returns simple, non-localized JSON. Future API error messages or descriptive texts, if any, will need to consider i18n as per `i18n-spec.md`.
