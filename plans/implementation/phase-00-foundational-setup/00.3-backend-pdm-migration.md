# Task 00.3: Backend Python Dependency Management Migration to PDM

**Phase:** 00 - Foundational Setup
**Parent Plan:** [00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

## 1. Objective

To migrate the backend Python project's dependency and environment management from a traditional `venv` and `requirements.txt` setup to PDM (Python Development Master). This aims to improve reproducibility, provide more robust dependency resolution, and streamline project tooling workflows. The migration includes initializing PDM, adding all existing production and development dependencies, configuring the project, and updating relevant documentation.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Specifically, the Tech Stack and Development Environment sections)
*   `00.1-project-initialization-tooling.md` (Provides context on the previous setup being migrated)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Preparation & Initial PDM Setup

*   [x] **Step 1.1:** Ensure PDM is installed.
    *   **Note:** This is a prerequisite. Installation via `pipx install pdm` or `pip install --user pdm`.
*   [x] **Step 1.2:** Deactivate any active virtual environment and remove the old `app/backend/.venv` directory to prevent conflicts.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Provide commands to deactivate a Python virtual environment and delete the `.venv` directory on Windows and Linux/macOS."
*   [x] **Step 1.3:** Navigate to the `app/backend/` directory.
*   [x] **Step 1.4:** Initialize PDM project.
    *   Command: `pdm init`
    *   Selections: Chose Python >=3.11, project name `hangar-bay-backend`, version `0.1.0`, description, author, MIT license. Confirmed `requires-python = ">=3.11"`. Opted NOT to import from `requirements.txt` at this stage for manual control.
*   [x] **Step 1.5:** Configure PDM to use an in-project virtual environment.
    *   Command: `pdm config venv.in_project true`

### 3.2. Dependency Migration

*   [x] **Step 2.1:** Add all production dependencies with pinned versions.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate PDM commands to add the following Python packages with their specified versions: fastapi==0.115.12, uvicorn[standard]==0.34.3, pydantic-settings==2.9.1, python-dotenv==1.1.0, asyncpg==0.30.0, redis==6.2.0, SQLAlchemy==2.0.41, alembic==1.16.1, aiosqlite==0.21.0."
    *   Commands executed:
        *   `pdm add fastapi==0.115.12`
        *   `pdm add "uvicorn[standard]==0.34.3"`
        *   `pdm add pydantic-settings==2.9.1`
        *   `pdm add python-dotenv==1.1.0`
        *   `pdm add asyncpg==0.30.0`
        *   `pdm add redis==6.2.0`
        *   `pdm add SQLAlchemy==2.0.41`
        *   `pdm add alembic==1.16.1`
        *   `pdm add aiosqlite==0.21.0`
*   [x] **Step 2.2:** Add development dependencies to a 'dev' group.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate PDM commands to add flake8 and black to the 'dev' dependency group."
    *   Commands executed:
        *   `pdm add --group dev flake8`
        *   `pdm add --group dev black`

### 3.3. Configuration & Tooling

*   [x] **Step 3.1:** Update the root `.gitignore` file.
    *   Ensure `app/backend/pdm.lock` is NOT ignored.
    *   Ensure `app/backend/.venv/` IS ignored (already present).
    *   Add ignores for PDM cache/config files: `app/backend/.pdm-python` and `app/backend/.pdm-build/`.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Suggest additions to the project's root .gitignore file to correctly handle PDM's lockfile, virtual environment, and cache files for a backend project located in `app/backend/`."
*   [x] **Step 3.2:** Define PDM run scripts in `app/backend/pyproject.toml`.
    *   Scripts for `lint` (flake8), `format` (black), and `dev` (uvicorn server).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate the TOML configuration for `[tool.pdm.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml` to include scripts: `lint` (runs `flake8 .`), `format` (runs `black .`), and `dev` (runs `uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`)."
    *   **Note:** The `dev` script was later updated to `uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --app-dir src` to resolve a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to the `src` layout (see Section 6).

### 3.4. Documentation Updates

*   [x] **Step 4.1:** Update the main project `README.md`.
    *   Add/update the "Development Setup" section to reflect PDM usage for backend: PDM installation, `pdm install -G dev`, and `pdm run` commands for linting, formatting, and running the dev server.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Draft the backend setup portion of a 'Development Setup' section for a project's README.md, explaining how to set up and use PDM for managing dependencies and running scripts (lint, format, dev server)."
*   [x] **Step 4.2:** (This task file itself) Review and finalize this task file `00.3-backend-pdm-migration.md`.

### 3.5. Cleanup & Finalization

*   [x] **Step 5.1:** Delete the old `app/backend/requirements.txt` file.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Provide the command to delete the `requirements.txt` file from the `app/backend/` directory."
*   [x] **Step 5.2:** Test the new PDM setup thoroughly.
    *   Run `pdm install -G dev` in a clean environment (or after removing `app/backend/.venv` and `pdm.lock` if necessary for testing initial install).
    *   Execute all defined PDM scripts: `pdm run lint`, `pdm run format`, `pdm run dev`.
    *   Verify the application starts and critical paths function as expected.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Ensure all dependencies are pinned to their exact versions as previously listed in `requirements.txt` or decided during migration.
*   When adding PDM scripts, ensure they correctly reference tools installed within the PDM-managed environment.
*   `.gitignore` updates should be specific to the `app/backend/` subdirectory for PDM files, while `pdm.lock` should be committed.
*   Documentation should be clear and provide actionable commands for developers.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [x] `app/backend/pyproject.toml` is correctly configured with project metadata, Python version, and all production and development dependencies.
*   [x] `app/backend/pdm.lock` file is generated and accurately reflects the resolved dependencies.
*   [x] All backend production and development dependencies are installable using `pdm install -G dev`.
*   [x] PDM scripts for `lint`, `format`, and `dev` are defined in `pyproject.toml` and function correctly via `pdm run`.
*   [x] The root `.gitignore` file is updated for PDM-specific files, ensuring `pdm.lock` is tracked.
*   [x] The main project `README.md` includes updated backend setup instructions reflecting PDM usage.
*   [x] The old `app/backend/requirements.txt` file is deleted.
*   [x] The PDM-based setup is tested (dependencies install, scripts run, server starts).
*   [x] This task document (`00.3-backend-pdm-migration.md`) is complete and accurately reflects the migration process.
*   [x] All changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Challenge:** Encountered a `PermissionError` when running `pdm init` initially.
    *   **Resolution:** The error was due to the old `app/backend/.venv` directory (from the previous `venv` setup) having restricted permissions or being in use. Deactivating any active virtual environment and deleting the old `app/backend/.venv` directory before running `pdm init` resolved the issue.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** When migrating environment management tools, always ensure any old environment directories are removed or renamed to avoid conflicts with the new tool's setup process.

*   **Challenge:** `pdm run dev` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi_app'`.
    *   **Resolution:** The Uvicorn server, when run from `app/backend/`, could not find the `fastapi_app` module located in `app/backend/src/`. The `dev` script in `app/backend/pyproject.toml` was updated from `uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` to `uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --app-dir src`. This tells Uvicorn to change its working directory to `src` before trying to import `fastapi_app.main`.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** When configuring server run commands (e.g., Uvicorn, Gunicorn) for projects with a `src` layout, ensure the application directory is correctly specified (e.g., using `--app-dir src` for Uvicorn) to prevent module import errors. Always verify that the server can locate the main application module from its execution context.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** N/A. This task focuses on development tooling, not application design features.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** No direct changes to secrets management. `.gitignore` continues to correctly ignore `.env` files. PDM itself does not introduce new secrets management concerns for this project's setup.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** Migrated to PDM, which helps ensure consistent and reproducible dependency trees via `pdm.lock`. This is a foundational step for ongoing vulnerability management (e.g., using `pdm export` and then `pip-audit` on the requirements, or future PDM plugins for auditing).
*   **Notes:** The primary security impact is improved dependency management, which is crucial for tracking and updating vulnerable packages.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A. This task does not involve application logging.
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** Observability concerns are not directly impacted by the choice of dependency manager.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** N/A. No new application code was written.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** PDM is used to manage development dependencies, including testing tools like `flake8` (linter) and `black` (formatter). PDM scripts (`pdm run lint`, `pdm run format`) facilitate running these tools. Future testing frameworks (e.g., `pytest`) will also be managed by PDM.
