# Task 00.2: Configuration Management

**Phase:** 00 - Foundational Setup
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish a robust configuration management system for both backend and frontend applications. This includes managing environment-specific settings (development, testing, production), handling sensitive information securely (e.g., API keys, database credentials), and ensuring easy configuration for developers and deployment pipelines.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Configuration Management, Technology Stack)
*   `../../design/security-spec.md` (Sections: Secrets Management, Data Security)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Backend (Python/FastAPI)

*   [ ] **Environment Variable Loading:**
    *   Integrate `python-dotenv` for loading environment variables from a `.env` file during local development.
    *   Ensure `.env` is listed in the project's root `.gitignore` file (as established in Task 00.1).
*   [ ] **Configuration Model:**
    *   Implement a Pydantic `BaseSettings` class to load and validate application settings from environment variables.
    *   Define settings for:
        *   `ENVIRONMENT` (e.g., "development", "production", "test")
        *   `DATABASE_URL`
        *   `CACHE_URL` (for Valkey/Redis)
        *   `ESI_CLIENT_ID` (placeholder, actual value to be secret)
        *   `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET` (placeholder, actual value to be secret)
        *   `LOG_LEVEL`
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Pydantic `BaseSettings` class for a FastAPI application. It should load `ENVIRONMENT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `CACHE_URL`, `ESI_CLIENT_ID`, `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `LOG_LEVEL` from environment variables. Include default values where appropriate for development (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL='INFO'`)."
*   [ ] **Example Configuration:**
    *   Create a `.env.example` file in the backend directory. This file should list all required environment variables with placeholder or example values.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a `.env.example` file based on the Pydantic `BaseSettings` class defined above, showing placeholder values for all variables."
*   [ ] **Integration:**
    *   Ensure the FastAPI application loads its configuration using the Pydantic `BaseSettings` class upon startup.

### 3.2. Frontend (Angular)

*   [ ] **Environment Files:**
    *   Utilize Angular's built-in environment files (`src/environments/environment.ts` for development and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` for production).
    *   Define settings for:
        *   `production` (boolean flag)
        *   `apiUrl` (the base URL for the backend API)
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example structure for Angular's `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` files, including a `production` flag and an `apiUrl` setting."
*   [ ] **Usage:**
    *   Demonstrate (or plan for) how these environment-specific settings will be imported and used within Angular services or components.

### 3.3. Secrets Management (General Approach)

*   [ ] **Documentation:**
    *   Document the strategy for managing actual secret values (API keys, database passwords) in production. This typically involves injecting them as environment variables through the deployment platform (e.g., Docker environment variables, CI/CD pipeline secrets) and NOT committing them to the repository.
    *   This task file can serve as the initial documentation point for this strategy. A brief note on where production secrets are sourced from is sufficient for now.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   When generating Pydantic settings, ensure proper type hinting and validation (e.g., for URLs).
*   Emphasize that `.env` files containing real secrets must never be committed to version control.
*   The `.env.example` file is crucial for onboarding new developers.
*   For Angular environments, highlight how the build process (`ng build --configuration production`) selects the correct file.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend configuration loading mechanism using Pydantic `BaseSettings` and `.env` files is implemented and tested locally.
*   A `.env.example` file is created for the backend, documenting required environment variables.
*   Frontend environment files (`environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`) are structured with initial settings.
*   The general strategy for managing production secrets (i.e., not in the repo) is documented within this task file.
*   All new configuration files (excluding `.env`) and code changes are committed to version control.
