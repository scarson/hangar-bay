# Task 00.2: Configuration Management

**Phase:** 00 - Foundational Setup
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish a robust configuration management system for both backend and frontend applications. This includes managing environment-specific settings (development, testing, production), handling sensitive information securely (e.g., API keys, database credentials), and ensuring easy configuration for developers and deployment pipelines.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Configuration Management, Technology Stack)
*   `../../design/security-spec.md` (Sections: Secrets Management, Data Security)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Backend (Python/FastAPI)

*   [x] **Environment Variable Loading:**
    *   Integrate `python-dotenv` for loading environment variables from a `.env` file during local development.
    *   Ensure `.env` is listed in the project's root `.gitignore` file (as established in Task 00.1).
*   [x] **Configuration Model:**
    *   Implement a Pydantic `BaseSettings` class to load and validate application settings from environment variables.
    *   Define settings for:
        *   `ENVIRONMENT` (e.g., "development", "production", "test")
        *   `DATABASE_URL`
        *   `CACHE_URL` (for Valkey/Redis)
        *   `ESI_CLIENT_ID` (placeholder, actual value to be secret)
        *   `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET` (placeholder, actual value to be secret)
        *   `LOG_LEVEL`
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Pydantic `BaseSettings` class for a FastAPI application. It should load `ENVIRONMENT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `CACHE_URL`, `ESI_CLIENT_ID`, `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `LOG_LEVEL` from environment variables. Include default values where appropriate for development (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL='INFO'`)."
*   [x] **Example Configuration:**
    *   Create a `.env.example` file in the backend directory. This file should list all required environment variables with placeholder or example values.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a `.env.example` file based on the Pydantic `BaseSettings` class defined above, showing placeholder values for all variables."
*   [x] **Integration:**
    *   Ensure the FastAPI application loads its configuration using the Pydantic `BaseSettings` class upon startup.

### 3.2. Frontend (Angular)

*   [x] **Environment Files:**
    *   Utilize Angular's built-in environment files (`src/environments/environment.ts` for development and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` for production).
    *   Define settings for:
        *   `production` (boolean flag)
        *   `apiUrl` (the base URL for the backend API)
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example structure for Angular's `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` files, including a `production` flag and an `apiUrl` setting."
*   [x] **Usage:**
    *   Demonstrate (or plan for) how these environment-specific settings will be imported and used within Angular services or components.
    *   *Note: Usage is planned. Settings will be imported from `src/environments/environment` and used, e.g., `environment.apiUrl` in services to make API calls.*

### 3.3. Secrets Management (General Approach)

*   [x] **Documentation:**
    *   Document the strategy for managing actual secret values (API keys, database passwords) in production. This typically involves injecting them as environment variables through the deployment platform (e.g., Docker environment variables, CI/CD pipeline secrets) and NOT committing them to the repository.
    *   This task file can serve as the initial documentation point for this strategy. A brief note on where production secrets are sourced from is sufficient for now.
    *   *Note: Production secrets (e.g., `DATABASE_URL` passwords, `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET`) **MUST NOT** be stored in `.env` files in production or committed to the repository. They will be injected as environment variables via the deployment platform (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, container orchestration secrets). For comprehensive details, refer to `../../design/security-spec.md#1.4. Secure Secret Storage and Management`.*

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   When generating Pydantic settings, ensure proper type hinting and validation (e.g., for URLs).
*   Emphasize that `.env` files containing real secrets must never be committed to version control.
*   The `.env.example` file is crucial for onboarding new developers.
*   For Angular environments, highlight how the build process (`ng build --configuration production`) selects the correct file.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend configuration loading mechanism using Pydantic `BaseSettings` and `.env` files is implemented and tested locally.
*   A `.env.example` file is created for the backend, documenting required environment variables.
*   Frontend environment files (`environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`) are structured with initial settings.
*   The general strategy for managing production secrets (i.e., not in the repo) is documented within this task file.
*   All new configuration files (excluding `.env`) and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 6.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [x] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Secure Design:** N/A for this task, which focused on the mechanism of configuration loading rather than overall system architecture.
    *   **Input Validation:** Pydantic's `BaseSettings` inherently provides validation for the structure and types of configuration values loaded from the environment. This ensures that the application starts with valid configuration, which is a security benefit. This addresses the validation of configuration "inputs."
    *   **Output Encoding:** N/A for this task as no user-facing outputs were generated.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A for this task.
    *   **Secrets Management:** This was a primary focus. The use of `.env` for local development (and its exclusion from git), `.env.example` for guidance, Pydantic `BaseSettings` for structured loading (including placeholders for secrets like `ESI_CLIENT_ID`, `ESI_CLIENT_SECRET`), and clear documentation on sourcing production secrets from the environment directly address the core requirements of `security-spec.md` (Section 1.4).
    *   **Dependency Management:** `python-dotenv` was added to `requirements.txt`. The security of this package, and all others, is subject to ongoing dependency scanning processes outlined in `security-spec.md` and `test-spec.md`.

### 6.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Structured Logging:** This task's primary contribution to observability is the inclusion of `LOG_LEVEL` in the backend's Pydantic `BaseSettings`. This allows the application's log verbosity to be configured via environment variables, which is a prerequisite for effective structured logging as defined in `observability-spec.md` (Section 2.1). Actual log formatting and output are for later tasks.
    *   **Other Items:** No actual logging mechanisms for key events or errors, metrics collection, or tracing were implemented as part of setting up configuration management. These will be addressed in tasks involving application logic development.

### 6.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** The Pydantic `BaseSettings` model in the backend is inherently testable for its loading logic, default values, and validation. Its correct functioning was manually verified during the task by ensuring the application could load settings from environment variables and the `.env` file.
    *   **Integration Tests & Coverage:** N/A for this task.
    *   **Test Data Management:** The creation of `.env.example` serves as a form of test data management for configuration, providing a template for local development setups, aligning with `test-spec.md` (Section 5) principles. Angular's environment files (`environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`) are part of its build system and are tested implicitly when the application is built and run in different modes.
    *   No specific test suites or test execution frameworks were set up or run as part of *this* task beyond the inherent verifications of the configuration mechanisms themselves.

### 6.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [x] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [x] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Overall:** This task focused on backend and frontend configuration setup, which does not directly involve UI elements. Therefore, accessibility concerns as outlined in `accessibility-spec.md` (such as semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.) are not applicable to the deliverables of this specific task. All items are marked [x] as N/A.
    *   Accessibility principles will be applied when UI components are developed in later tasks.

### 6.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [x] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [x] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [x] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Text Abstraction, Locale-Specific Formatting, UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A for this task as no UI or user-facing text requiring translation was generated.
    *   **Character Encoding:** The primary I18n consideration met is the adherence to UTF-8 encoding for all text-based configuration files (e.g., `.env.example`, `environment.ts`), which is a foundational requirement (`i18n-spec.md`, Section 2).
    *   Configuration values themselves are typically not subject to localization. Any user-facing strings that might *originate* from configuration would need to be passed through an i18n system at the point they are prepared for display, which is outside the scope of this task.
