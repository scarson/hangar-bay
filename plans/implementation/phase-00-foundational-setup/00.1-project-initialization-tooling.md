# Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling

**Phase:** 00 - Foundational Setup
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish the initial project directory structure, initialize language-specific dependency management, set up essential development tooling (linters, formatters), configure version control ignores, and update the main `README.md` with development setup instructions.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Tech Stack, Development Environment)
*   `../../../README.md` (for updates)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Directory Structure

*   [x] Confirmed backend directory as `backend/` (root level).
*   [x] Confirmed frontend directory as `frontend/` (root level).
*   [x] Ensured all paths are referenced correctly based on root-level `backend/` and `frontend/` directories (e.g., for PYTHONPATH, Docker contexts, `ng new` commands, etc.).
*   [x] Ensured `plans/implementation` structure is in place.

### 3.2. Backend (Python/FastAPI)

*   [x] Navigated to the `backend/` directory.
*   [x] Installed PDM (Python Dependency Manager) globally or per user (e.g., `pipx install pdm` or `pip install --user pdm`).
*   [x] Initialized PDM project: Ran `pdm init` in `backend/`.
    *   Selected a Python interpreter (e.g., Python >=3.11).
    *   Set project name (e.g., `hangar-bay-backend`), version, description, author, license.
    *   Set `requires-python = ">=3.11"`.
    *   Chose not to import from `requirements.txt` initially.
    *   This created `pyproject.toml` and `pdm.lock`.
*   [x] Configured PDM to use an in-project virtual environment: `pdm config venv.in_project true`. The `.venv` is managed by PDM and included in root `.gitignore`.
*   [x] Added core production dependencies using `pdm add <package>==<version>`:
        *   `pdm add fastapi==0.115.12`
        *   `pdm add "uvicorn[standard]==0.34.3"`
        *   `pdm add pydantic-settings==2.9.1`
        *   `pdm add python-dotenv==1.1.0`
        *   `pdm add SQLAlchemy==2.0.41`
        *   `pdm add alembic==1.16.1`
        *   `pdm add asyncpg==0.30.0`
        *   `pdm add redis==6.2.0`
        *   `pdm add aiosqlite==0.21.0`
*   [x] Added development dependencies using `pdm add --group dev <package>`:
        *   `pdm add --group dev flake8`
        *   `pdm add --group dev black`
*   [x] Created a `.flake8` configuration file in `backend/`.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a .flake8 configuration file for a FastAPI project, including common checks and reasonable line length (e.g., 99)."
*   [x] Defined PDM run scripts in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pdm.scripts]` for common tasks:
    *   `lint = "flake8 ."`
    *   `format = "black ."`
    *   `dev = "uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"`
*   **AI Prompt for running tools:** "Show commands to lint and format backend Python code using PDM run scripts (e.g., `pdm run lint`, `pdm run format`)."

### 3.3. Frontend (Angular)

*   [x] Navigated to the project root to generate the frontend in `frontend/`.
*   [x] Initialized a new Angular project: `ng new hangar-bay-frontend --directory frontend --routing --style=scss`. Ensured this matches `design-spec.md` choices.
*   [x] Verified `frontend/package.json` with Angular core dependencies.
*   [x] Added Prettier for formatting: `npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier` in `frontend/` directory.
*   [x] Added ESLint for linting (set up by Angular CLI during project generation).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a .prettierrc.json configuration file for an Angular project with sensible defaults (e.g., singleQuote: true, trailingComma: 'all', printWidth: 100). Place it in the `frontend/` directory."
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show command to format frontend code using Prettier from the `frontend/` directory or project root."

### 3.4. Version Control

*   [x] Create/Update the root `.gitignore` file to include common ignores for Python, Node, OS-specific files, and IDE files.
    *   Ensure `.env` files, `*.sqlite3` (for dev DB), `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `coverage/` are included.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a comprehensive .gitignore file for a project with a Python/FastAPI backend and an Angular frontend."

### 3.5. Documentation

*   [x] Update the main project `../../../README.md` with clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment for both backend and frontend. Include commands for installing dependencies and running linters/formatters.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Draft a 'Development Setup' section for the project README.md. It should cover: cloning, backend Python virtual environment setup, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, frontend `npm install` (or `yarn install`), and commands to run the dev servers."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   When generating configuration files (`.flake8`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.gitignore`), prioritize common best practices and ensure compatibility with the chosen tech stack.
*   For `requirements.txt` and `package.json`, use recent, stable versions of libraries unless a specific version is required by the project specifications.
*   Focus on creating actionable checklists that can be followed by a human developer or used to guide further AI actions.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend and frontend directory structures are established.
*   Dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`) are created with initial MVP dependencies.
*   Linters and formatters are installed and configured for both backend and frontend.
*   A comprehensive `.gitignore` file is in place at the project root.
*   The main `README.md` includes clear development setup instructions.
*   All initial setup files are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Challenge:** Initial `.gitignore` was not comprehensive enough, leading to potential accidental commits of IDE files or local environment files.
    *   **Resolution:** Utilized a comprehensive `.gitignore` template (e.g., generated by AI or from gitignore.io) and manually verified it included common patterns for Python (e.g., `backend/.venv/`, `backend/__pycache__/`, `backend/*.pyc`), Node.js (`frontend/node_modules/`, `frontend/dist/`, `frontend/coverage/`), OS-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`), and common IDEs (e.g., `.vscode/`, `.idea/`). Ensured `.env` files (e.g. `backend/.env`) and local database files (e.g., `*.sqlite3`) were explicitly included.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** Always start with a comprehensive `.gitignore`. Regularly review and update it as new tools or file types are introduced.

*   **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent Python versions and robust package management, especially for collaboration or CI/CD.
    *   **Resolution:** While `requirements.txt` pins dependencies, the project adopted the practice of explicitly documenting the recommended Python version (e.g., Python 3.10+) in `README.md`. For this project, standard `venv` and `pip` with `requirements.txt` were deemed sufficient for MVP.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** For Python projects, always recommend and document a specific Python version. For more complex projects or larger teams, consider tools like `pyenv` for managing Python versions and `Poetry` or `PDM` for more advanced dependency management, packaging, and virtual environment handling.

*   **Challenge:** Frontend and backend directory naming conventions (e.g., `app/backend`, `app/frontend` vs. root-level `backend/`, `frontend/`) needed to be decided early and applied consistently.
    *   **Resolution:** The project structure settled on root-level `backend/` and `frontend/` directories. This decision was made and applied consistently across configurations and documentation.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** Clarify and confirm top-level directory structure (e.g., `backend/`, `frontend/` or `src/backend/`, `src/frontend/`) at the very beginning of project setup. Ensure all subsequent path references in configurations, Dockerfiles, CI/CD scripts, and documentation are consistent with this decision.

*   **Challenge:** Remembering to activate the Python virtual environment before installing packages or running backend scripts can be a common oversight.
    *   **Resolution:** Emphasized virtual environment activation steps (e.g., `source backend/.venv/bin/activate` or `backend\.venv\Scripts\activate`) very clearly in the `README.md` setup instructions for the backend.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** Always include explicit virtual environment activation commands in setup instructions. If context suggests a user might be running Python commands globally within a project that uses a venv, gently remind them to activate it.

*   **Challenge:** Initial `README.md` setup instructions might miss small but crucial steps, or assume prior knowledge, making onboarding difficult for newcomers.
    *   **Resolution:** Iteratively refined `README.md` to be as explicit and step-by-step as possible. Included commands not just for installing dependencies but also for running linters/formatters and development servers, along with expected outputs or verification steps where appropriate.
    *   **Future Cascade/Developer Note:** When generating README setup instructions, aim for a 'copy-paste runnable' sequence of commands that works in a clean environment. Include simple verification steps (e.g., "you should see the server running on http://localhost:8000").

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** Ensure project initialization adheres to `security-spec.md#1.4`. This includes setting up `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files and any other local secret stores, and establishing the principle of loading secrets from the environment.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** Initial dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`) were created. Regular vulnerability scanning (e.g., `pip-audit`, `npm audit`) as per `security-spec.md` (Section 1.8) and `test-spec.md` (Section 7) will be part of CI/CD and ongoing development, but the initial files themselves are a prerequisite.
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Secure Design, Input Validation, Output Encoding, Authentication/Authorization:** These are N/A for this foundational task, which did not involve implementing application logic or APIs. These will be addressed in subsequent tasks as per `security-spec.md`.
    *   **Secrets Management:** The primary action was configuring `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files and other sensitive local files, aligning with `security-spec.md` (Section 1.4.1, 1.4.2). This establishes the practice of not committing secrets.
    *   **Dependency Management:** The creation of `requirements.txt` and `package.json` is the first step. The `security-spec.md` (Section 1.8) emphasizes keeping dependencies updated and scanned for vulnerabilities. This task lays the groundwork for those ongoing processes.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Structured Logging:** N/A for this task. While the `observability-spec.md` mandates structured logging (Section 2.1), this task focused on initial project setup and did not involve implementing logging configurations. This will be addressed when application components are developed.
    *   **Key Events Logged:** N/A for this task. No specific application events were defined or instrumented.
    *   **Error Logging:** N/A for this task. No error handling or logging mechanisms were implemented.
    *   **Correlation IDs:** N/A for this task. No request handling or distributed tracing setup was part of this initialization.
    *   **Metrics:** N/A for this task. No metrics collection or exposure was implemented.
    *   **Overall:** This task established the foundational project structure. Observability concerns, including structured logging, metrics, and tracing as detailed in `design/observability-spec.md`, will be addressed in subsequent tasks that involve developing application logic, API endpoints, and user interface components. The selection of specific observability tools (Section 3 of `observability-spec.md`) is also pending.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** N/A for this task. No specific application logic, components, or functions requiring unit tests were developed. The `test-spec.md` (Section 3.1) outlines that tools like `pytest` (backend) and Jasmine/Karma (frontend) will be used. Setup of these test runners and initial test harnesses will occur in subsequent tasks.
    *   **Integration Tests:** N/A for this task. No inter-component interactions were implemented.
    *   **Test Coverage:** N/A for this task. No tests were written, so no coverage metrics apply.
    *   **Test Data Management:** N/A for this task.
    *   **Overall:** This task focused on project initialization. The testing frameworks and initial test suites as per `design/test-spec.md` (e.g., `pytest` for backend, Karma/Jasmine for frontend, and considerations for E2E, performance, accessibility, and i18n testing) will be established and populated in later development phases. The task did include installing `flake8` and `black` (Python) and `prettier` and `eslint` (Angular), which are foundational for code quality and indirectly support testability by ensuring consistent code.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **Overall:** N/A for this task. This task focused on backend and frontend project initialization (directory structure, dependency files, linters, formatters, `.gitignore`, and `README.md` updates). No user interface components were designed or implemented.
    *   Accessibility principles outlined in `design/accessibility-spec.md` (targeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA) will be applied during the development of UI components in subsequent tasks. This includes considerations for semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for images. The `README.md` was updated, which is user-facing, but its content is primarily textual and structured with Markdown, which has inherent accessibility benefits when rendered correctly by browsers/Markdown viewers. No complex interactive elements requiring specific A11y considerations were added to `README.md`.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [ ] **String Externalization:** (e.g., all UI text in resource files)
*   [ ] **Locale-Aware Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currency)
*   [x] **UTF-8 Encoding:** (e.g., for all text data and files)
*   [ ] **Language Selection Mechanism:** (e.g., UI for users to choose language)
*   [ ] **Translatable Accessibility Strings:** (e.g., `alt` text, `aria-label`s)
*   **Notes:**
    *   **String Externalization:** N/A for this task. No user-facing application strings requiring externalization were implemented.
    *   **Locale-Aware Formatting:** N/A for this task. No data formatting was implemented.
    *   **UTF-8 Encoding:** The project aims to use UTF-8 encoding for all text data and files, as per `design/i18n-spec.md` (Section 2). Files created in this task (e.g., `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`) are expected to be UTF-8. Linters and IDE settings should enforce this. This is marked as [x] as the principle is established and files created adhere.
    *   **Language Selection Mechanism:** N/A for this task. No UI was developed.
    *   **Translatable Accessibility Strings:** N/A for this task, as no UI elements requiring such attributes were created.
    *   **Overall:** This foundational task did not involve direct implementation of i18n features. The project's default language is English (`en`), and the ESI API fallback is `en-us` as per `design/i18n-spec.md`. Future tasks involving UI or user-facing API messages will incorporate specific i18n mechanisms (Babel for backend, @angular/localize for frontend).
