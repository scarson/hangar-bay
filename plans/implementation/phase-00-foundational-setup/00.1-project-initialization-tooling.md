# Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling

**Phase:** 00 - Foundational Setup
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish the initial project directory structure, initialize language-specific dependency management, set up essential development tooling (linters, formatters), configure version control ignores, and update the main `README.md` with development setup instructions.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Tech Stack, Development Environment)
*   `../../../README.md` (for updates)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Directory Structure

*   [x] Confirm backend directory (e.g., `app/backend`).
*   [x] Confirm frontend directory (e.g., `app/frontend`).
*   [x] Ensure all paths, especially `app/backend` and `app/frontend`, are referenced correctly as we generate configurations and code (e.g., for PYTHONPATH, Docker contexts, ng new commands, etc.).
*   [x] Ensure `plans/implementation` structure is in place.

### 3.2. Backend (Python/FastAPI)

*   [ ] Navigate to the backend directory.
*   [x] Initialize a virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`). Add `.venv` to global `.gitignore` if not already present.
*   [x] Create an initial `requirements.txt` with core dependencies:
    *   `fastapi`
    *   `uvicorn[standard]`
    *   `pydantic`
    *   `SQLAlchemy`
    *   `psycopg2-binary` (for PostgreSQL)
    *   `alembic`
    *   `python-dotenv` (for config)
    *   `valkey` (or redis if valkey client is under redis namespace)
*   [x] Set up Flake8 for linting: `pip install flake8` and create a basic `.flake8` configuration file.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a .flake8 configuration file for a FastAPI project, including common checks and reasonable line length (e.g., 99)."
*   [x] Set up Black for formatting: `pip install black`.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show command to format backend Python code using Black with default settings."

### 3.3. Frontend (Angular)

*   [ ] Navigate to the frontend directory.
*   [x] Initialize a new Angular project if not already present (e.g., `ng new hangar-bay-frontend --routing --style=scss`). Ensure this matches `design-spec.md` choices.
*   [x] Verify/Create `package.json` with Angular core dependencies.
*   [x] Add Prettier for formatting: `npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier` or `yarn add --dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`.
*   [x] Add ESLint for linting (typically set up by Angular CLI).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a .prettierrc.json configuration file with sensible defaults (e.g., singleQuote: true, trailingComma: 'all')."
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show command to format frontend code using Prettier."

### 3.4. Version Control

*   [x] Create/Update the root `.gitignore` file to include common ignores for Python, Node, OS-specific files, and IDE files.
    *   Ensure `.env` files, `*.sqlite3` (for dev DB), `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `coverage/` are included.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a comprehensive .gitignore file for a project with a Python/FastAPI backend and an Angular frontend."

### 3.5. Documentation

*   [x] Update the main project `../../../README.md` with clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment for both backend and frontend. Include commands for installing dependencies and running linters/formatters.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Draft a 'Development Setup' section for the project README.md. It should cover: cloning, backend Python virtual environment setup, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, frontend `npm install` (or `yarn install`), and commands to run the dev servers."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   When generating configuration files (`.flake8`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.gitignore`), prioritize common best practices and ensure compatibility with the chosen tech stack.
*   For `requirements.txt` and `package.json`, use recent, stable versions of libraries unless a specific version is required by the project specifications.
*   Focus on creating actionable checklists that can be followed by a human developer or used to guide further AI actions.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend and frontend directory structures are established.
*   Dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`) are created with initial MVP dependencies.
*   Linters and formatters are installed and configured for both backend and frontend.
*   A comprehensive `.gitignore` file is in place at the project root.
*   The main `README.md` includes clear development setup instructions.
*   All initial setup files are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 6.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** Ensure project initialization adheres to `security-spec.md#1.4`. This includes setting up `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files and any other local secret stores, and establishing the principle of loading secrets from the environment.
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 6.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 6.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
