# Task 05.2: Update API Endpoints for F002

**Phase:** 05 - Backend - F002: Advanced Search & Filtering Logic
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To update the existing backend API endpoints (or create new ones if necessary) to accept, validate, and process the advanced filter parameters defined in Feature F002, utilizing the enhanced filtering logic from Task 05.1.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Defines advanced filter parameters for API)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Existing FastAPI endpoints to be modified)
*   Task 05.1: Advanced Filtering Logic & Query Enhancements (Logic to be integrated)
*   `../../../design/api-design-guide.md` (If exists, for API consistency)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Identify API Endpoint Changes:**
    *   The primary endpoint to update is `/api/v1/contracts/ships` (defined in Task 02.4 and F001). This endpoint will be enhanced to accept additional query parameters for advanced filtering as per F002.
    *   No new endpoints are anticipated for F002's ship contract browsing and filtering requirements.
*   [ ] **Update FastAPI Request Models (Pydantic):**
    *   Define a comprehensive Pydantic model (e.g., `ShipContractFilters`) that encapsulates all advanced filter query parameters for the `/api/v1/contracts/ships` endpoint, as detailed in `../../../design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Section 4.2 API Design). This model will be used as FastAPI dependencies (`Depends`).
    *   Ensure appropriate validation rules (e.g., `Optional`, `gt`, `lt`, `min_length`, `max_length`, `List` types) and default values are applied using FastAPI's `Query`.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a Pydantic model `ShipContractFilters` to be used as FastAPI query parameters. It should include the following fields, all optional, with appropriate types and FastAPI `Query` validations/defaults:
        *   `ship_name: Optional[str] = Query(None, min_length=3, description='Search by ship name (partial match, case-insensitive).')`
        *   `contract_title: Optional[str] = Query(None, min_length=3, description='Search by contract title (partial match, case-insensitive).')`
        *   `min_price: Optional[float] = Query(None, gt=0, description='Minimum contract price.')`
        *   `max_price: Optional[float] = Query(None, gt=0, description='Maximum contract price.')`
        *   `min_collateral: Optional[float] = Query(None, ge=0, description='Minimum collateral.')`
        *   `max_collateral: Optional[float] = Query(None, gt=0, description='Maximum collateral.')`
        *   `min_volume: Optional[float] = Query(None, gt=0, description='Minimum item volume.')`
        *   `max_volume: Optional[float] = Query(None, gt=0, description='Maximum item volume.')`
        *   `min_runs: Optional[int] = Query(None, ge=1, description='Minimum runs for BPCs.')`
        *   `max_runs: Optional[int] = Query(None, ge=1, description='Maximum runs for BPCs.')`
        *   `min_me: Optional[int] = Query(None, ge=0, le=10, description='Minimum material efficiency for BPCs.')`
        *   `max_me: Optional[int] = Query(None, ge=0, le=10, description='Maximum material efficiency for BPCs.')`
        *   `min_te: Optional[int] = Query(None, ge=0, le=20, description='Minimum time efficiency for BPCs.')`
        *   `max_te: Optional[int] = Query(None, ge=0, le=20, description='Maximum time efficiency for BPCs.')`
        *   `region_id: Optional[List[int]] = Query(None, description='List of region IDs to filter by.')`
        *   `solar_system_id: Optional[List[int]] = Query(None, description='List of solar system IDs to filter by.')`
        *   `station_id: Optional[List[int]] = Query(None, description='List of station IDs (start_location_id) to filter by.')`
        *   `ship_type_id: Optional[List[int]] = Query(None, description='List of ship type IDs to filter by.')`
        *   `ship_group_id: Optional[List[int]] = Query(None, description='List of ship group IDs to filter by.')`
        *   `is_bpc: Optional[bool] = Query(None, description='Filter by whether the primary item is a blueprint copy.')`
        *   `is_corp_contract: Optional[bool] = Query(None, description='Filter by whether the contract is for a corporation.')`
        *   `contract_type: Optional[str] = Query(None, description='Filter by contract type (e.g., item_exchange, auction).')`
        *   `page: int = Query(1, ge=1, description='Page number.')`
        *   `size: int = Query(20, ge=1, le=100, description='Number of items per page.')`
        *   `sort_by: Optional[str] = Query('date_issued', description='Field to sort by.')`
        *   `sort_direction: Optional[str] = Query('desc', description='Sort direction (asc or desc).')`
        This model will be injected into the endpoint using `params: ShipContractFilters = Depends()`."
*   [ ] **Integrate Advanced Filtering Logic:**
    *   In the `/api/v1/contracts/ships` endpoint handler, the injected `ShipContractFilters` Pydantic model instance (containing all validated query parameters) will be passed to the backend service layer. This service layer will use these parameters to construct and execute the dynamic database query using the logic developed in Task 05.1.
*   [ ] **Ensure API Response Consistency:**
    *   Verify that API responses remain consistent with existing structures or are appropriately versioned/extended if changes are significant.
*   [ ] **Update API Documentation:**
    *   Regenerate or manually update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to reflect the new filter parameters and any changes to request/response schemas.
    *   Clearly document how to use the new advanced filters.
*   [ ] **Testing:**
    *   Write integration tests for the API endpoints with various combinations of advanced filters to ensure they work end-to-end.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use FastAPI's `Query` for detailed validation of query parameters.
*   Ensure clear error messages are returned for invalid filter combinations or values.
*   Consider API versioning if changes are breaking for existing clients (though for MVP, direct updates are common).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Relevant FastAPI API endpoints are updated to accept new advanced filter parameters from F002.
*   Pydantic request models are updated with new filter fields and validation.
*   The advanced filtering logic from Task 05.1 is correctly integrated into the endpoint handlers.
*   API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) is updated to reflect changes.
*   Integration tests for the updated API endpoints with advanced filters are implemented and passing.
*   All new/modified code is committed to version control.
