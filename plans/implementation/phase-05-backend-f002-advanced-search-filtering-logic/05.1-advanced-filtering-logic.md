# Task 05.1: Advanced Filtering Logic & Query Enhancements

**Phase:** 05 - Backend - F002: Advanced Search & Filtering Logic
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To enhance the backend's database query capabilities to support advanced search and filtering requirements as defined in Feature F002. This includes implementing logic for more complex filter combinations, text-based searches, and range queries.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Defines advanced filtering criteria)
*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Backend Architecture, Database Design)
*   Task 02.2: Data Models for F001 (Existing SQLAlchemy models to be queried)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Existing query logic to be extended)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Analyze F002 Advanced Filter Requirements:**
    *   Thoroughly review `/design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Section 4.2 API Design & Section 5.1 Detailed Filtering Capabilities) for all specified advanced filters. Key filterable fields include:
        *   **Text Search:** Ship Name (from `EsiTypeCache.name` via `ContractItem.type_id`), Contract Title (`Contract.title`).
        *   **Numeric Ranges:** Price, Collateral, Volume (from `Contract`); Runs, Material Efficiency (ME), Time Efficiency (TE) (from `ContractItem` for BPCs).
        *   **Categorical/ID-based:** Ship Type ID (`ContractItem.type_id`), Ship Group ID (`EsiTypeCache.group_id`), Region ID (`Contract.region_id`), Solar System ID (requires SDE lookup or pre-calculated field), Station ID (`Contract.start_location_id`).
        *   **Boolean:** `is_blueprint_copy` (from `ContractItem`), `for_corporation` (from `Contract`).
        *   **Contract Type:** (`Contract.type`, e.g., 'item_exchange', 'auction').
*   [ ] **Design SQLAlchemy Query Enhancements:**
    *   Plan how to translate F002 filter requirements into SQLAlchemy query conditions.
    *   Consider using `ILIKE` or full-text search capabilities for item name/type searches.
    *   Implement logic for range filters (e.g., `price_min`, `price_max`).
    *   Consider how to join `Contract` with `ContractItem` (specifically the primary ship item) and `EsiTypeCache` to allow filtering on fields from all three tables for ship contracts (where `Contract.is_ship_contract == True`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example SQLAlchemy query targeting the `Contract` model. The query should filter for `Contract.is_ship_contract == True`. It needs to join with `ContractItem` (aliased, to represent the primary ship item in the contract) and `EsiTypeCache` (joined from `ContractItem.type_id`). Demonstrate how to apply filters for: 
        1. Ship name (from `EsiTypeCache.name`) using `ILIKE '%search_term%'`. 
        2. Contract price (from `Contract.price`) between `min_price` and `max_price`. 
        3. Number of runs (from `ContractItem.runs`) for a BPC between `min_runs` and `max_runs`. 
        4. `ContractItem.is_blueprint_copy == True`."
*   [ ] **Implement Dynamic Query Building:**
    *   Develop a strategy to dynamically build SQLAlchemy queries based on the presence of various optional filter parameters.
    *   Ensure that only provided filters are applied to the query.
*   [ ] **Update/Extend Pydantic Models (for internal use if needed):**
    *   If complex filter objects are passed internally within the backend, update or create Pydantic models for them. (API-facing models are handled in Task 05.2).
*   [ ] **Performance Considerations:**
    *   Analyze potential performance impacts of new filter combinations.
    *   Identify necessary database indexes for new query patterns (refer to Task 02.2 for existing indexes).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Given the F002 advanced filtering requirements for ship contracts, what database indexes should be considered across the `Contract`, `ContractItem`, and `EsiTypeCache` tables? Key filterable fields include: `Contract.price`, `Contract.collateral`, `Contract.volume`, `Contract.region_id`, `Contract.start_location_id`, `Contract.type`, `Contract.is_ship_contract`, `Contract.title`; `ContractItem.type_id`, `ContractItem.is_blueprint_copy`, `ContractItem.runs`, `ContractItem.material_efficiency`, `ContractItem.time_efficiency`; `EsiTypeCache.name`, `EsiTypeCache.group_id`. Consider text searches on `EsiTypeCache.name` and `Contract.title`, and range queries on numeric fields."
*   [ ] **Unit Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for the new filtering logic to ensure correctness with various filter combinations.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Leverage SQLAlchemy's flexible query construction capabilities.
*   For text search, evaluate PostgreSQL's full-text search features (e.g., `tsvector`, `tsquery`) if simple `ILIKE` is insufficient for performance or relevance.
*   Ensure that database sessions are managed correctly, especially with complex queries.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend logic can construct and execute database queries incorporating advanced filters from F002.
*   Dynamic query building handles optional filter parameters correctly.
*   Performance implications are considered, and potential indexing needs are identified.
*   Internal Pydantic models (if any) for filter parameters are updated.
*   Unit tests for the advanced filtering logic are implemented and passing.
*   All new/modified code is committed to version control.
