# Task 08.1: Contract Detail Component

**Phase:** 08 - Frontend - F003: Detailed View Implementation
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To develop an Angular component that displays the detailed information for a single contract, including all its items and metadata, fetched from the backend API endpoint created in Task 07.1.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/features/F003-Detailed-Ship-Contract-View.md` (Defines what data to display and how)
*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: UI/UX Principles, Frontend Architecture)
*   `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md` (Guidelines for accessible data presentation)
*   Task 07.1: API Endpoint for F003 (Backend API providing the detailed contract data)
*   Task 03.2: Backend API Service Layer (Service to call the new endpoint)
*   Task 03.3: Basic Layout, Routing, and Navigation (Routing to this detail view)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Generate Contract Detail Component:**
    *   Use Angular CLI: `ng generate component features/contracts/contract-detail` (or similar path).
*   [ ] **Implement Routing to Detail View:**
    *   Update Angular routing (e.g., in `app-routing.module.ts` or a feature module) to include a route for the contract detail view, typically using a route parameter for the `contract_id`.
    *   Example: `{ path: 'contracts/:id', component: ContractDetailComponent }`.
    *   Ensure navigation from the contract list (Task 04.1) to this detail view (e.g., by making contract IDs clickable).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to define an Angular route `/contracts/:id` that loads `ContractDetailComponent` and how to navigate to this route from another component, passing a `contractId`."
*   [ ] **Fetch Contract ID from Route:**
    *   In `ContractDetailComponent`, use Angular's `ActivatedRoute` service to get the `contract_id` from the route parameters.
*   [ ] **Integrate API Service:**
    *   Inject the API service (from Task 03.2).
    *   Create a new method in the API service to call the detailed contract endpoint (Task 07.1), e.g., `getContractById(contractId: string): Observable<DetailedContract>`.
    *   In `ContractDetailComponent`, call this service method using the fetched `contract_id`.
    *   Handle the `Observable` response.
*   [ ] **Define Data Display Structure:**
    *   Based on F003, design the HTML template to display all relevant contract details:
        *   Main contract attributes (issuer, price, volume, type, status, dates, locations).
        *   A list or table of included items with their details (name, quantity).
    *   Consider layout for clarity and readability.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate an Angular component template (`.html`) to display detailed contract information. The contract object has `issuer_name`, `price`, `type`, `status`, `date_issued`, `start_location_name`, and a list of `items` (each with `type_name`, `quantity`). Structure it clearly."
*   [ ] **Styling:**
    *   Apply SCSS styling for a polished presentation, consistent with the rest of the application.
*   [ ] **Loading and Error States:**
    *   Implement UI indicators for when data is loading.
    *   Display a user-friendly message if the contract is not found (e.g., based on a 404 from the API) or if another error occurs.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular's `ActivatedRoute` to access route parameters.
*   Ensure strong typing for the detailed contract data received from the API.
*   Present complex information in a clear, organized, and accessible manner.
*   Consider how users will navigate back from the detail view (e.g., breadcrumbs, back button).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   `ContractDetailComponent` is created.
*   Routing to the component with a `contract_id` parameter is implemented.
*   The component fetches and displays detailed information for a specific contract from the backend.
*   All required contract and item details as per F003 are displayed.
*   Loading and error/not-found states are handled gracefully.
*   The component is styled appropriately and integrates with the application's navigation.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 6.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 6.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 6.5. Internationalization (I18n)

*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
