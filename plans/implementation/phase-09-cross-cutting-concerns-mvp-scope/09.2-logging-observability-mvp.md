# Task 09.2: Logging & Basic Observability (MVP)

**Phase:** 09 - Cross-Cutting Concerns (MVP Scope)
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To implement structured logging in the backend application and establish basic observability practices for monitoring application health and diagnosing issues in the MVP.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md` (Guidelines for logging and monitoring)
*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Section: Observability)
*   FastAPI documentation on logging.

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Backend (FastAPI)
*   [ ] **Structured Logging Setup:**
    *   Configure Python's `logging` module for structured logging (e.g., JSON format).
    *   Include key information in log entries: timestamp, log level, message, logger name, request ID (if applicable), relevant context (e.g., user ID if/when auth is added).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to configure Python's standard `logging` module in a FastAPI application to output logs in JSON format, including timestamp, level, message, and logger name."
*   [ ] **Log Key Events:**
    *   Add logging for:
        *   Application startup and shutdown.
        *   Incoming requests (method, path, client IP - consider GDPR).
        *   Outgoing responses (status code).
        *   Errors and exceptions (with stack traces).
        *   Significant business logic events (e.g., contract aggregation start/finish, errors during aggregation).
        *   Security-relevant events (e.g., failed validation, potential suspicious activity - to be defined further).
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:**
    *   Implement a mechanism for request/correlation IDs to trace a single request through different parts of the system (e.g., using a middleware).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Demonstrate how to create a FastAPI middleware that generates a unique request ID for each incoming request and makes it available for logging purposes."
*   [ ] **Health Check Endpoint Review:**
    *   Ensure the health check endpoint (from Task 01.1) is robust and reflects the actual health of the application (e.g., database connectivity).
*   [ ] **Log Levels Configuration:**
    *   Allow log levels to be configured via environment variables (as per Task 00.2).

### Frontend (Angular)
*   [ ] **Basic Error Logging:**
    *   Implement a basic global error handler in Angular to catch unhandled exceptions.
    *   Log these errors to the browser console. For MVP, sending them to a backend logging service is optional but preferred if time allows.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to create a custom `ErrorHandler` in Angular to log unhandled exceptions to the console."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use structured logging to make logs easily parsable and searchable.
*   Avoid logging sensitive information (PII, secrets) unless absolutely necessary and properly secured/masked.
*   Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
*   Ensure logs provide enough context to diagnose issues.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend: Structured logging (JSON) is implemented. Key events, errors, and requests are logged with correlation IDs. Health check endpoint is reviewed. Log levels are configurable.
*   Frontend: Basic global error handler logs errors to the console.
*   Logging practices align with `observability-spec.md`.
*   All new/modified code is committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions
