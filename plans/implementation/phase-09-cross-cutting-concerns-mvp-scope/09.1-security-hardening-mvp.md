# Task 09.1: Security Hardening (MVP)

**Phase:** 09 - Cross-Cutting Concerns (MVP Scope)
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To implement foundational security measures across the backend and frontend, addressing key OWASP Top 10 risks and adhering to the project's security principles for the MVP scope.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/security-spec.md` (Primary security guidelines and principles)
*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Section: Security)
*   OWASP Top 10 (General reference)
*   FastAPI Security Documentation
*   Angular Security Best Practices

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Backend (FastAPI)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:**
    *   Ensure all incoming data (query params, path params, request bodies) is strictly validated using Pydantic models.
    *   Review all existing endpoints (Phases 01, 02, 05, 07) for robust validation.
*   [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement:**
    *   Configure the production deployment environment (Task 10.1, 10.2) to enforce HTTPS.
    *   Ensure HSTS headers are considered.
*   [ ] **Dependency Security:**
    *   Run `pip-audit` or similar tool to check for known vulnerabilities in Python dependencies.
    *   Update vulnerable packages where feasible.
*   [ ] **Rate Limiting (Basic):**
    *   Implement basic rate limiting on sensitive or public API endpoints (e.g., using `slowapi`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show a basic example of how to implement rate limiting per IP address for a FastAPI endpoint using the `slowapi` library."
*   [ ] **Security Headers:**
    *   Implement common security headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy` - basic restrictive policy for MVP).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Provide a list of common security headers and their recommended values for a FastAPI application, and show how to add them as middleware."
*   [ ] **Error Handling:**
    *   Ensure generic error messages are returned to users, avoiding leakage of sensitive internal details (as per `security-spec.md`).
*   [ ] **Secrets Management Review (Ref: `security-spec.md#1.4`):**
    *   Verify that secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.) are managed securely via environment variables, as detailed in `security-spec.md#1.4`.
    *   Confirm no plaintext secrets are in code or committed configuration files.
    *   Ensure `.env` files (if used for local development) are correctly gitignored.

### Frontend (Angular)
*   [ ] **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
    *   Leverage Angular's built-in XSS protection (contextual auto-escaping).
    *   Review any uses of `[innerHTML]` or manual DOM manipulation for potential risks. Sanitize if unavoidable.
*   [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP) - Meta Tag (if applicable):**
    *   Consider adding a basic CSP via a meta tag in `index.html` as a defense-in-depth measure, complementing HTTP headers from the backend/CDN.
*   [ ] **Dependency Security:**
    *   Run `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies.
    *   Update vulnerable packages where feasible.
*   [ ] **API Communication:**
    *   Ensure all API calls are made over HTTPS (enforced by backend).

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Prioritize addressing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities relevant to web applications.
*   Refer to `security-spec.md` for Hangar Bay specific principles (Zero Trust, Assume Breach, etc.).
*   Use security linters and scanners where possible.
*   Focus on secure defaults and configurations for all technologies used.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend: Input validation reviewed, HTTPS configuration planned, basic rate limiting and security headers implemented, error handling reviewed, secrets management confirmed.
*   Frontend: XSS review conducted, CSP consideration made, dependencies audited.
*   A security checklist based on `security-spec.md` and OWASP Top 10 has been reviewed against the MVP features.
*   Identified vulnerabilities in dependencies are documented or addressed.
*   All new/modified code and configurations are committed to version control.
