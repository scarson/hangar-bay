# Task 09.3: Testing Strategy & Implementation (MVP)

**Phase:** 09 - Cross-Cutting Concerns (MVP Scope)
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish and implement a foundational testing strategy for the MVP, including unit tests for critical backend logic and frontend components, and basic integration tests for API endpoints.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/test-spec.md` (Overall testing strategy and guidelines)
*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Section: Testing)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Backend (FastAPI)
*   [ ] **Unit Testing Setup (`pytest`):**
    *   Ensure `pytest` is configured (from Task 00.1).
    *   Organize tests in a `tests/` directory.
*   [ ] **Write Unit Tests for Core Logic:**
    *   Identify critical business logic (e.g., contract aggregation service - Task 02.3, advanced filtering logic - Task 05.1).
    *   Write unit tests using `pytest`, mocking external dependencies (database, ESI client) where appropriate.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `pytest` unit test for a Python function `process_data(items)` that transforms a list of items. Mock any external service calls within this function."
*   [ ] **Integration Testing for API Endpoints:**
    *   Use FastAPI's `TestClient` to write integration tests for key API endpoints (contract listing, detail view, filtering - Tasks 02.4, 05.2, 07.1).
    *   Test success cases, error cases (e.g., invalid input, not found), and authentication/authorization if/when implemented.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Provide an example of an integration test for a FastAPI endpoint `/items/{item_id}` using `TestClient`. Test for a successful response (200) and a not found response (404)."
*   [ ] **Database State for Tests:**
    *   Plan for managing database state for integration tests (e.g., test-specific database, transactions with rollback, fixtures to populate data). For MVP, in-memory SQLite for tests can be an option if complex PG features aren't heavily used.

### Frontend (Angular)
*   [ ] **Unit Testing Setup (Karma/Jasmine):**
    *   Angular CLI generates basic testing setup with Karma and Jasmine.
*   [ ] **Write Unit Tests for Key Components/Services:**
    *   Identify key components (e.g., `ContractListComponent` - Task 04.1, `ContractDetailComponent` - Task 08.1, `AdvancedFilterComponent` - Task 06.1) and services (`ApiService` - Task 03.2).
    *   Write unit tests, mocking service dependencies and testing component logic and rendering.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show a basic Jasmine unit test for an Angular component `MyComponent` that calls a method on an injected service `MyService` when a button is clicked. Spy on the service method."
*   [ ] **Basic End-to-End (E2E) Test Consideration (Optional for MVP):**
    *   Evaluate feasibility of 1-2 simple E2E tests using Protractor/Cypress for critical user flows (e.g., viewing contract list). This is optional if time is constrained for MVP.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Focus tests on verifying requirements and critical paths.
*   Aim for good test coverage of business logic and complex UI interactions.
*   Keep unit tests small, focused, and fast.
*   Use descriptive test names.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Backend: `pytest` setup is confirmed. Unit tests for critical logic are written. Integration tests for key API endpoints are implemented. Strategy for test database state is defined.
*   Frontend: Karma/Jasmine setup is confirmed. Unit tests for key components and services are written.
*   Testing practices align with `test-spec.md`.
*   All new/modified test code is committed to version control.
*   A basic CI step to run tests is planned (Task 10.2).
