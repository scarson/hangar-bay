# Task 09.4: Accessibility & i18n Stubs (MVP)

**Phase:** 09 - Cross-Cutting Concerns (MVP Scope)
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To ensure basic accessibility (a11y) considerations are reviewed and implemented in the frontend, and to set up foundational stubs for internationalization (i18n) to facilitate future expansion.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md` (Primary accessibility guidelines)
*   `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md` (Future i18n strategy, if detailed)
*   WCAG 2.1 AA Guidelines (Reference)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### Accessibility (Angular Frontend)
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML Review:**
    *   Review key components (contract list, detail, filters - Tasks 04.1, 08.1, 06.1) for use of semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, proper heading structure).
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes (Basic):**
    *   Identify areas where basic ARIA attributes could enhance accessibility (e.g., `aria-label` for icon buttons, `aria-required` for form fields). Implement where straightforward.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Provide examples of using `aria-label` for an icon button and `aria-describedby` for a form field with an error message in an Angular template."
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   Manually test keyboard navigation for major interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) in implemented features. Ensure all are focusable and operable.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast (Brief Check):**
    *   Briefly review primary text and background color combinations for adequate contrast. Use a browser tool for a quick check.
*   [ ] **Image Alt Text (If any images used):**
    *   Ensure any `<img>` tags have appropriate `alt` attributes.
*   [ ] **Automated Accessibility Check (Basic):**
    *   Run a basic automated accessibility checker tool (e.g., Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, axe DevTools browser extension) on key pages. Document major findings.

### Internationalization (i18n) Stubs (Angular Frontend)
*   [ ] **Install i18n Library (e.g., `@ngx-translate/core`):**
    *   Install a library for handling translations. `@ngx-translate/core` is a popular choice.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show the npm command to install `@ngx-translate/core` and `@ngx-translate/http-loader` for an Angular project."
*   [ ] **Basic Configuration:**
    *   Set up the basic configuration for the chosen i18n library in `AppModule` (e.g., `TranslateModule.forRoot(...)`).
    *   Create a basic `en.json` language file in `assets/i18n/` with a few sample placeholder strings.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show a basic setup for `@ngx-translate/core` in an Angular `AppModule` using `TranslateHttpLoader` to load JSON files from `assets/i18n/`."
*   [ ] **Example Usage:**
    *   Replace a few hardcoded strings in one or two components (e.g., a page title or button label) with the i18n translation mechanism (e.g., `{{ 'MY_STRING_KEY' | translate }}`).
    *   Verify that these strings are loaded from the `en.json` file.
*   [ ] **No Language Switching UI for MVP:**
    *   For MVP, implementing a language switcher UI is not required. The goal is to have the foundational setup.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

### Accessibility
*   Focus on fundamental a11y practices. Full WCAG compliance is a larger effort.
*   Use browser developer tools and accessibility extensions for testing.
*   Refer to `accessibility-spec.md` for project-specific a11y goals.

### Internationalization
*   The aim for MVP is to lay the groundwork, not full translation.
*   Choose an i18n library that is well-maintained and fits Angular.
*   Keep initial i18n setup simple.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Accessibility: Key components reviewed for semantic HTML. Basic ARIA attributes applied where obvious. Keyboard navigation tested. Basic color contrast check performed. Automated accessibility check run and findings noted.
*   Internationalization: i18n library installed and configured. Basic `en.json` file created with sample strings. A few hardcoded strings replaced with i18n mechanism as a proof-of-concept.
*   Practices align with `accessibility-spec.md` and initial i18n goals.
*   All new/modified code and configuration files are committed to version control.
