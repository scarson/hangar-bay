# Task 03.3: Basic Layout, Routing, and Navigation

**Phase:** 03 - Frontend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish a basic application layout (header, content area, footer), set up initial Angular routing for future feature components, and implement a simple navigation menu.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Frontend Architecture, UI/UX Principles)
*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Implies a view for contract listing)
*   `../../../design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Implies a view for ship browsing/search)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Create Core Layout Components:**
    *   Generate components for common layout elements:
        *   `ng generate component core/layout/header`
        *   `ng generate component core/layout/footer`
    *   Update `AppComponent` (`app.component.html`) to include these layout components and a `<router-outlet>` for content.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `app.component.html` for an Angular app that includes a header component, a footer component, and a `router-outlet`."
*   [ ] **Define Initial Routes:**
    *   In `app-routing.module.ts` (or wherever routing is configured):
        *   Define placeholder routes for main features (e.g., `/contracts` for F001, `/ships` for F002).
        *   Create dummy/placeholder components for these routes for now (e.g., `ng g c features/contracts/contract-list-placeholder`, `ng g c features/ships/ship-browse-placeholder`).
        *   Set up a default route (e.g., redirect to `/contracts`).
        *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate an example Angular `Routes` array for `app-routing.module.ts` with a default redirect to `/contracts`, a route for `/contracts` loading `ContractListComponent`, and a route for `/ships` loading `ShipBrowseComponent`."
*   [ ] **Implement Basic Navigation:**
    *   In the `HeaderComponent`, add basic navigation links (e.g., "Contracts", "Ships") using `routerLink` directive.
    *   Style the header and navigation minimally.
*   [ ] **Styling for Layout:**
    *   Add basic SCSS to `styles.scss` or layout component styles to ensure a clean, usable layout (e.g., flexbox for main content area, sticky footer if desired).

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular Router for all navigation. Avoid direct `href` links for internal navigation.
*   Lazy loading modules can be considered later for optimization; for MVP, direct component loading in routes is fine.
*   Keep layout components simple and focused on structure.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Core layout components (header, footer) are created and integrated into `AppComponent`.
*   Initial routes for F001 and F002 (with placeholder components) are defined.
*   Basic navigation links are present in the header.
*   The application has a discernible basic layout structure.
*   Navigation between placeholder routes works.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
