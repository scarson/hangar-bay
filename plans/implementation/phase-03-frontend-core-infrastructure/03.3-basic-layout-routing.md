# Task 03.3: Basic Layout, Routing, and Navigation

**Phase:** 03 - Frontend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To establish a basic application layout (header, content area, footer), set up initial Angular routing for future feature components, and implement a simple navigation menu.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Frontend Architecture, UI/UX Principles)
*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Implies a view for contract listing)
*   `../../../design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Implies a view for ship browsing/search)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Create Core Layout Components:**
    *   Generate components for common layout elements:
        *   `ng generate component core/layout/header`
        *   `ng generate component core/layout/footer`
    *   Update `AppComponent` (`app.component.html`) to include these layout components and a `<router-outlet>` for content.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `app.component.html` for an Angular app that includes a header component, a footer component, and a `router-outlet`."
*   [ ] **Define Initial Routes:**
    *   In `app-routing.module.ts` (or wherever routing is configured):
        *   Define a primary route for the main contract browsing page, e.g., `/browse-contracts`. This page will serve F001 (listing) and F002 (advanced filtering).
        *   Create a placeholder component for this route (e.g., `ng g c features/contract-browsing/browse-contracts-page`). This component will later be developed in Phase 04 (Task 04.1).
        *   Set up a default route that redirects to `/browse-contracts` (e.g., `{ path: '', redirectTo: '/browse-contracts', pathMatch: 'full' }`).
        *   Optionally, consider adding a wildcard route for a Page Not Found component (e.g., `ng g c core/components/page-not-found`, then route `{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }`).
        *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate an example Angular `Routes` array for `app-routing.module.ts`. It should include:
            *   A default route: `{ path: '', redirectTo: '/browse-contracts', pathMatch: 'full' }`.
            *   A main feature route: `{ path: 'browse-contracts', component: BrowseContractsPageComponent }` (assuming `BrowseContractsPageComponent` is the placeholder/actual component for this view).
            *   (Optional but recommended) A wildcard route: `{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }` (assuming `PageNotFoundComponent` exists)."
*   [ ] **Implement Basic Navigation:**
    *   In the `HeaderComponent`, add a basic navigation link for the primary feature, e.g., "Browse Contracts", using the `routerLink` directive pointing to `/browse-contracts`.
    *   Style the header and navigation minimally.
*   [ ] **Styling for Layout:**
    *   Add basic SCSS to `styles.scss` or layout component styles to ensure a clean, usable layout (e.g., flexbox for main content area, sticky footer if desired).

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular Router for all navigation. Avoid direct `href` links for internal navigation.
*   Lazy loading modules can be considered later for optimization; for MVP, direct component loading in routes is fine.
*   Keep layout components simple and focused on structure.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Core layout components (header, footer) are created and integrated into `AppComponent`.
*   Initial routes for F001 and F002 (with placeholder components) are defined.
*   Basic navigation links are present in the header.
*   The application has a discernible basic layout structure.
*   Navigation between placeholder routes works.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
