# Task 03.1: Angular Application Skeleton

**Phase:** 03 - Frontend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To initialize a new Angular application using the Angular CLI, set up the basic project structure, configure SCSS for styling, and establish initial linting and formatting rules.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Technology Stack, Frontend Architecture)
*   `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md` (Initial considerations for accessible component structure)
*   Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling (for ESLint, Prettier setup if shared or analogous)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Install Angular CLI:**
    *   Ensure Angular CLI is installed globally or use `npx @angular/cli`.
*   [ ] **Generate New Angular Application:**
    *   Navigate to the root project directory (or a `frontend/` subdirectory if preferred).
    *   Run `ng new hangar-bay-frontend --style=scss --routing=true --strict=true --standalone=false`. (Using `standalone=false` for traditional NgModule approach initially, can be migrated later if desired. Strict mode enabled.)
    *   Name the application appropriately (e.g., `hangar-bay-frontend`).
    *   Choose SCSS for styling.
    *   Enable routing.
*   [ ] **Initial Project Structure Review:**
    *   Familiarize with the generated Angular project structure (`src/`, `app/`, `assets/`, `environments/`).
*   [ ] **Linting and Formatting:**
    *   Angular CLI includes ESLint. Review its configuration (`.eslintrc.json`).
    *   Integrate Prettier for code formatting, ensuring it works alongside ESLint (e.g., `eslint-config-prettier`).
    *   Add npm scripts to `package.json` for linting and formatting (e.g., `"lint": "ng lint"`, `"format": "prettier --write ."`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `package.json` script to run ESLint and Prettier for an Angular project."
*   [ ] **Global Styles Setup:**
    *   Locate `src/styles.scss`.
    *   Plan for basic global style resets or a base theme structure (e.g., variables for colors, typography). For now, ensure it's usable.
*   [ ] **Verify Application Runs:**
    *   Run `ng serve` and ensure the default Angular application page loads in the browser.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use the Angular CLI for generating components, services, etc., to maintain consistency.
*   Enable strict mode in Angular for better type checking and catching errors early.
*   Ensure Prettier and ESLint configurations are compatible to avoid conflicts.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   A new Angular application is generated with SCSS and routing.
*   ESLint and Prettier are configured and integrated into npm scripts.
*   Basic global style structure in `styles.scss` is considered.
*   The default Angular application runs successfully using `ng serve`.
*   All new files and configurations are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
