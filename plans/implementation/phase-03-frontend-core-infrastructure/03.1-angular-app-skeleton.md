# Task 03.1: Angular Application Skeleton

**Phase:** 03 - Frontend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To initialize a new Angular application using the Angular CLI, set up the basic project structure, configure SCSS for styling, and establish initial linting and formatting rules.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Technology Stack, Frontend Architecture)
*   `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md` (Initial considerations for accessible component structure)
*   Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling (for ESLint, Prettier setup if shared or analogous)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Install Angular CLI:**
    *   Ensure Angular CLI is installed globally or use `npx @angular/cli`.
*   [ ] **Generate New Angular Application:**
    *   Navigate to the root project directory (or a `frontend/` subdirectory if preferred).
    *   Run `ng new hangar-bay-frontend --style=scss --routing=true --strict=true --standalone=false`. (Using `standalone=false` for traditional NgModule approach initially, can be migrated later if desired. Strict mode enabled.)
    *   Name the application appropriately (e.g., `hangar-bay-frontend`).
    *   Choose SCSS for styling.
    *   Enable routing.
*   [ ] **Initial Project Structure Review:**
    *   Familiarize with the generated Angular project structure (`src/`, `app/`, `assets/`, `environments/`).
*   [ ] **Linting and Formatting:**
    *   Angular CLI includes ESLint. Review its configuration (`.eslintrc.json`).
    *   Integrate Prettier for code formatting, ensuring it works alongside ESLint (e.g., `eslint-config-prettier`).
    *   Add npm scripts to `package.json` for linting and formatting (e.g., `"lint": "ng lint"`, `"format": "prettier --write ."`).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `package.json` script to run ESLint and Prettier for an Angular project."
*   [ ] **Global Styles Setup:**
    *   Locate `src/styles.scss`.
    *   Plan for basic global style resets or a base theme structure (e.g., variables for colors, typography). For now, ensure it's usable.
*   [ ] **Verify Application Runs:**
    *   Run `ng serve` and ensure the default Angular application page loads in the browser.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use the Angular CLI for generating components, services, etc., to maintain consistency.
*   Enable strict mode in Angular for better type checking and catching errors early.
*   Ensure Prettier and ESLint configurations are compatible to avoid conflicts.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   A new Angular application is generated with SCSS and routing.
*   ESLint and Prettier are configured and integrated into npm scripts.
*   Basic global style structure in `styles.scss` is considered.
*   The default Angular application runs successfully using `ng serve`.
*   All new files and configurations are committed to version control.
