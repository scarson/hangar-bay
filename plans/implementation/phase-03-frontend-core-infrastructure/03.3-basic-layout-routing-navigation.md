# Task 03.3: Basic Layout, Routing, and Navigation

## 1. Objective

To establish a basic application layout using Header and Footer components (managed by `CoreModule` from Task 03.0). This task also includes setting up initial Angular routing for future feature components and implementing a simple navigation menu within the Header component.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Frontend Architecture, UI/UX Principles)
*   `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Implies a view for contract listing)
*   `/design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (Implies a view for ship browsing/search)
*   [Task 03.0: Angular Core Module Setup](./03.0-angular-core-module-setup.md) (Layout components will be part of `CoreModule`)
*   `/design/specifications/angular-routing-best-practices.md` (Guidelines for Angular routing)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Create Core Layout Components:**
    *   Generate components for common layout elements (assuming component prefix `hgb` from Task 03.1):
        *   `ng generate component core/layout/header` (will create `HeaderComponent` in `src/app/core/layout/header/`)
        *   `ng generate component core/layout/footer` (will create `FooterComponent` in `src/app/core/layout/footer/`)
    *   These components should be declared in `CoreModule` (from Task 03.0) and also **explicitly added to the `exports: []` array** of `CoreModule` to be usable by `AppComponent` (as per `/design/specifications/angular-frontend-architecture.md#2.2`).
    *   **Component Best Practices (refer to `/design/specifications/angular-frontend-architecture.md`):**
        *   Apply `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` to `HeaderComponent` and `FooterComponent` (see section `#3.3`).
        *   If these components manage internal state (e.g., mobile menu visibility), use Angular Signals (see section `#6.1`).
        *   For any dependency injection (e.g., `Router`), use the `inject()` function (see section `#8.1`).
    *   Ensure `CommonModule` from `@angular/common` is imported into `CoreModule`'s `imports: []` array, as `HeaderComponent` or `FooterComponent` might use common directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `routerLink`, `routerLinkActive`).
    *   Update `AppComponent` (`app.component.html`) to use these components (e.g., `<hgb-header></hgb-header>`, `<hgb-footer></hgb-footer>`) and a `<router-outlet>` for content.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `app.component.html` for an Angular app that uses custom-prefixed components `<hgb-header></hgb-header>` and `<hgb-footer></hgb-footer>`, and a `<router-outlet>`."
*   [ ] **Define Initial Routes:**
    *   In `app-routing.module.ts` (or wherever routing is configured):
        *   **Create a Feature Module and Placeholder Component for Contract Browsing:**
            *   To align with `angular-frontend-architecture.md`, create a new, minimal feature module for contract browsing. From `app/frontend/`, run: `ng generate module features/contract-browsing --routing`. This creates `ContractBrowsingModule` and its own `contract-browsing-routing.module.ts`.
            *   Generate a placeholder component within this new feature module: `ng generate component features/contract-browsing/browse-contracts-page --module=contract-browsing`. This component (`BrowseContractsPageComponent`) will be declared in `ContractBrowsingModule` and serve F001/F002. It will be fully developed in Phase 04 (Task 04.1).
            *   Ensure `ContractBrowsingRoutingModule` defines a route (e.g., `{ path: '', component: BrowseContractsPageComponent }`) for its root path.
        *   **Configure `AppRoutingModule`:**
            *   The main route for contract browsing (e.g., `/browse-contracts`) must be **manually added** to `app-routing.module.ts` to lazy-load `ContractBrowsingModule`. Example: `{ path: 'browse-contracts', loadChildren: () => import('./features/contract-browsing/contract-browsing.module').then(m => m.ContractBrowsingModule) }`.
            *   [ ] **Verify Lazy-Loaded Route:** Manually confirm that the `loadChildren` path for `ContractBrowsingModule` in `app-routing.module.ts` is correct and resolves as expected.
            *   Set up a default route that redirects to `/browse-contracts` (e.g., `{ path: '', redirectTo: '/browse-contracts', pathMatch: 'full' }`).
            *   Optionally, consider adding a Page Not Found component and route: `ng g c core/components/page-not-found --module=core`. If created, ensure `PageNotFoundComponent` is declared in `CoreModule` and **also added to `CoreModule`'s `exports: []` array.** Then, route in `AppRoutingModule`: `{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }`.
        *   **AI Prompt (for `AppRoutingModule`):** "Generate an example Angular `Routes` array for `app-routing.module.ts`. It should include:
            *   A default route: `{ path: '', redirectTo: '/browse-contracts', pathMatch: 'full' }`.
            *   A lazy-loaded main feature route for 'browse-contracts': `{ path: 'browse-contracts', loadChildren: () => import('./features/contract-browsing/contract-browsing.module').then(m => m.ContractBrowsingModule) }`.
            *   (Optional but recommended) A wildcard route: `{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }` (assuming `PageNotFoundComponent` is declared and exported by `CoreModule` and `CoreModule` is imported by `AppModule`)."
*   [ ] **Implement Basic Navigation:**
    *   In the `HeaderComponent`, add a basic navigation link for the primary feature, e.g., "Browse Contracts", using the `routerLink` directive pointing to `/browse-contracts`.
    *   Style the header and navigation minimally.
*   [ ] **Styling for Layout:**
    *   Add basic SCSS. For truly global styles (e.g., `body` background, typography resets, main content area flexbox structure around `<router-outlet>`), use `app/frontend/src/styles.scss`. For styles specific to the `HeaderComponent` or `FooterComponent`'s internal structure and appearance, use their respective encapsulated SCSS files (e.g., `header.component.scss`). Be mindful of Angular's default view encapsulation.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular Router for all navigation. Avoid direct `href` links for internal navigation.
*   Lazy loading for the main feature module (`ContractBrowsingModule`) is implemented as per architectural guidelines. Further optimization of other potential feature modules can be done later.
*   Remember that styles in a component's SCSS file are encapsulated by default and won't 'leak' out, and global styles won't penetrate into component internals without specific techniques (which should generally be avoided for layout components if possible; prefer styling the host element or passing data/classes).
*   Keep layout components simple and focused on structure.
*   **Layout Component Practices:** For `HeaderComponent`, `FooterComponent`, and similar layout elements:
    *   Utilize `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for performance.
    *   Manage any internal component state with Angular Signals.
    *   Use the `inject()` function for dependency injection.
    *   Refer to `/design/specifications/angular-frontend-architecture.md` for detailed guidance on component design, state management, and coding style.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Core layout components (header, footer) are created, declared in `CoreModule`, **correctly exported by `CoreModule`**, and integrated into `AppComponent`.
*   A `ContractBrowsingModule` (with its own routing) is created, containing a placeholder `BrowseContractsPageComponent`.
*   `AppRoutingModule` is manually configured to lazy-load `ContractBrowsingModule` for the `/browse-contracts` path, and includes a default redirect. The lazy-load path is verified.
*   If `PageNotFoundComponent` is created as part of `CoreModule`, it is correctly declared AND exported by `CoreModule`.
*   Basic navigation links are present in the header.
*   The application has a discernible basic layout structure.
*   Navigation between placeholder routes works.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. **Ensure this section is completed according to the Hangar Bay CCC review procedure (see Memory `0c495baf-94e6-4dfa-81c1-a386d94c813e` or similar).** Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** N/A for basic layout structure.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A for static layout components.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** Angular templates provide XSS protection by default for interpolated content. Ensure any dynamic content bound to `innerHTML` (should be avoided) is properly sanitized if ever used.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A for basic layout. Navigation links should not expose routes prematurely if they require auth (though current routes are public).
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** No new external dependencies for these layout components.
*   **Notes:** Ensure links in navigation use `routerLink` and not `href` for internal routes to prevent full page reloads and leverage Angular router security features.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A for basic layout components directly.
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** Navigation events are implicitly handled by Angular Router. Specific logging for route changes can be added via router event subscriptions if needed for analytics (beyond scope of this task).
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** Errors during routing or component rendering will be handled by Angular's default error handling or a global error handler (if implemented later).
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A
*   **Notes:** Direct observability concerns for static layout components and basic routing are minimal. Adherence to `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md` will apply to more dynamic parts of the application. (Ref: Phase 0 Review - Observability)

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Create basic unit tests for `HeaderComponent` and `FooterComponent` to ensure they render without errors. Test `routerLink` directives if navigation logic becomes complex.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** Plan to test `AppComponent` to ensure Header, Footer, and `router-outlet` are correctly composed and that basic routing transitions occur.
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** Aim for reasonable unit and integration test coverage for these structural components and routing setup.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** N/A for simple layout components and basic routing.
*   **Notes:** Focus on structural integrity, basic rendering, and navigation. Adhere to `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`. (Ref: Phase 0 Review - Testing)

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Use `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>` (around `<router-outlet>`) HTML5 elements appropriately. Use `<h1>` for site title/logo in header if applicable.
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** Add `role="banner"` to header, `role="contentinfo"` to footer, `role="navigation"` to nav element. Consider `aria-label` for navigation if multiple nav regions exist.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** Ensure navigation links in header are keyboard accessible and focusable.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** Placeholder for when actual styling is applied. Ensure sufficient contrast for text/backgrounds in header/footer.
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Basic structure should be screen-reader friendly. Test navigation links.
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** If logo or other images are added to header/footer, ensure appropriate alt text.
*   **Notes:** Foundational accessibility for page structure. Adhere to `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`. (Ref: Phase 0 Review - Accessibility)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** Any text in header/footer (e.g., site name, copyright, nav links) should be identified as needing i18n if the application will support multiple languages. For MVP, hardcoded English is acceptable but note for future i18n pass.
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A for basic layout text.
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** Consider if fixed-width elements in header/footer might break with longer translated strings.
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Ensure HTML and component files use UTF-8.
*   **Notes:** Minimal impact for this task, but flag any text content (e.g., in Header/Footer) for future i18n. Adhere to `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`. (Ref: Phase 0 Review - I18n)
