# Task 03.1: Angular Core Configuration

## 1. Objective

Configure the application's root providers in `app.config.ts` for essential services like routing, HTTP communication, and zoneless change detection. This centralized file replaces the legacy `CoreModule` pattern in a standalone architecture.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/angular/00-angular-architecture-overview.md`
*   `/design/angular/guides/08-performance-and-change-detection.md`
*   `/design/angular/guides/07-http-and-data-loading.md`
*   `/design/angular/patterns/03-lazy-loaded-routes.md`

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Configure Zoneless Change Detection:**
    *   In `app.config.ts`, import `provideZoneChangeDetection` from `@angular/core`.
    *   Add it to the `providers` array with the `noop` zone implementation to disable Zone.js.
        ```typescript
        // app/src/app/app.config.ts
        import { ApplicationConfig, provideZoneChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';

        export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
          providers: [
            provideZoneChangeDetection({ ngZone: 'noop' })
          ]
        };
        ```

*   [ ] **Configure Application Routing:**
    *   Import `provideRouter` from `@angular/router` and the `routes` from `./app.routes.ts`.
    *   Add `provideRouter(routes)` to the `providers` array. Enable `withComponentInputBinding()` for easy route parameter binding and `withViewTransitions()` for smooth page transitions.
        ```typescript
        // app/src/app/app.config.ts
        import { provideRouter, withComponentInputBinding, withViewTransitions } from '@angular/router';
        import { routes } from './app.routes';

        // ... inside providers array
        provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding(), withViewTransitions()),
        ```

*   [ ] **Configure `HttpClient`:**
    *   Import `provideHttpClient` from `@angular/common/http`.
    *   Add it to the `providers` array to make `HttpClient` available for injection throughout the application.
        ```typescript
        // app/src/app/app.config.ts
        import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

        // ... inside providers array
        provideHttpClient()
        ```

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   When adding providers to `app.config.ts`, ensure they are pure functions (e.g., `provideRouter(...)`, `provideHttpClient()`) for tree-shakability.
*   This file is the single source of truth for application-wide providers. Avoid using `providedIn: 'root'` on services that are not truly global or that have complex dependencies.
*   **Modern Practices for Services:** When services are provided by the application configuration (e.g., `ContractApiService` from Task 03.2):
    *   Prefer Angular Signals for managing and exposing reactive state (see `/design/angular/guides/04-state-management-and-rxjs.md`).
    *   Utilize the `inject()` function for dependency injection within these services for better type inference and readability (see `/design/angular/guides/08-performance-and-change-detection.md#8.1`).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   `app.config.ts` is updated with the provider for zoneless change detection (`provideZoneChangeDetection`).
*   `app.config.ts` is updated with the provider for application routing (`provideRouter`).
*   `app.config.ts` is updated with the provider for `HttpClient` (`provideHttpClient`).
*   The application compiles and runs successfully with the new core configuration.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** N/A for this configuration task.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** N/A.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** N/A.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** `HttpClient` interceptors, which can be configured here later, are the designated place for adding auth tokens.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** N/A.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** No new external dependencies are added in this task.
*   **Notes:** All checklist items are marked `[x]` as they have been considered and deemed either addressed by future plans or Not Applicable for this specific configuration task.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** N/A.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** N/A.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** `HttpClient` interceptors, configured here, will be the future home for a global error logging service.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** This task sets the stage for future observability features by providing the `HttpClient`. All items are marked `[x]` as they have been considered and deemed either addressed by future plans or Not Applicable.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** The plan requires creating a unit test for `app.config.ts` to verify that all essential providers (`provideRouter`, `provideHttpClient`, etc.) are correctly included.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** N/A.
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** N/A.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** Verifying the core application configuration via a unit test is a critical step to prevent runtime errors due to misconfiguration.

### 7.4. Accessibility
*   [x] **Semantic HTML:** N/A.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigation:** N/A.
