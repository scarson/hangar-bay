# Task 03.2: Backend API Service Layer

**Phase:** 03 - Frontend Core Infrastructure
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To create a dedicated Angular service (or services) responsible for communicating with the backend FastAPI. This includes setting up `HttpClientModule`, defining base API URL from environment configuration, and creating initial methods for fetching data.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Frontend Architecture, API Communication)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (Angular `environment.ts` for `apiUrl`)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Backend endpoints to call)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Import `HttpClientModule`:**
    *   Import `HttpClientModule` into the root `AppModule` (or a relevant shared module).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to import `HttpClientModule` into an Angular `AppModule`."
*   [ ] **Create API Service(s):**
    *   Generate a new Angular service using the CLI (e.g., `ng generate service core/services/api` or `ng g s features/contracts/contract-api`).
    *   Inject `HttpClient` into the service.
*   [ ] **Configure Base API URL:**
    *   Utilize the `apiUrl` from Angular's environment files (`src/environments/environment.ts`) to prefix API calls.
    *   Ensure `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` have the correct `apiUrl` for local development and production.
*   [ ] **Implement Initial API Methods:**
    *   Based on the backend API endpoint from Task 02.4 (`GET /api/v1/contracts/ships`), create an initial method in the service to fetch ship contracts.
    *   Define TypeScript interfaces for the request parameters (e.g., `ShipContractsRequestParams`) and the response data structures (e.g., `PaginatedShipContractsResponse` containing `ShipContract` items). These should align with the Pydantic schemas defined in Task 02.4 (e.g., `ShipContractRead`).
    *   Example method: `getShipContracts(params?: ShipContractsRequestParams): Observable<PaginatedShipContractsResponse>`
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate TypeScript interfaces for an Angular API service:
        1.  `ShipContract`: Based on the F001 `ShipContractRead` Pydantic schema. Include fields like `contract_id: number`, `title?: string`, `price?: number`, `status: string`, `date_issued: string` (or `Date`), `date_expired: string` (or `Date`), `start_location_name?: string`, `ship_type_id: number`, `ship_name: string`, `is_blueprint_copy?: boolean`, `runs?: number`, `material_efficiency?: number`, `time_efficiency?: number`.
        2.  `PaginatedShipContractsResponse`: A generic pagination wrapper. Include `items: ShipContract[]`, `total: number`, `page: number`, `size: number`, `pages: number`.
        3.  `ShipContractsRequestParams`: For query parameters. Include `page?: number`, `size?: number`, `ship_type_id?: number`, `is_bpc?: boolean`.

        Then, generate an Angular service method `getShipContracts` that uses `HttpClient`. This method should:
        - Make a GET request to `[apiUrl]/api/v1/contracts/ships`.
        - Accept an optional `params: ShipContractsRequestParams` object for query parameters.
        - Construct `HttpParams` from the `params` object, ensuring undefined/null parameters are omitted.
        - Return an `Observable<PaginatedShipContractsResponse>`."
*   [ ] **Error Handling Strategy (Initial):**
    *   Consider a basic error handling approach for API calls (e.g., using RxJS `catchError` operator) to log errors or transform them for UI display. A more robust global error handler can be implemented later.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use strong typing for API request and response objects.
*   Leverage RxJS operators for handling asynchronous data streams from `HttpClient`.
*   Keep API services focused; consider separate services for different resource types if the API grows complex.
*   Ensure the `apiUrl` is correctly sourced from environment files.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   `HttpClientModule` is imported and available.
*   An Angular service for backend communication is created.
*   The service uses `apiUrl` from environment files.
*   Initial methods for fetching contract data (as per F001 backend API) are implemented with appropriate TypeScript types.
*   Basic error handling consideration is in place for API calls.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)

*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
