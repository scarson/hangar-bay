# Task 03.2: Backend API Service Layer

## 1. Objective

To create a dedicated Angular service (e.g., `BackendApiService`) to act as a centralized, injectable service for all backend HTTP communications. This service will use Angular's `HttpClient`, which is made available application-wide via `provideHttpClient` in `app.config.ts` (see Task 03.1).

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `design/angular/00-angular-architecture-overview.md`
*   `/design/angular/guides/07-http-and-data-loading.md`
*   `/design/angular/patterns/01-signal-state-service.md`
*   `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Backend Data Models: `/plans/implementation/phase-02-backend-f001-public-contract-aggregation/02.2-data-models-f001.md`
*   Backend API Endpoints: `/plans/implementation/phase-02-backend-f001-public-contract-aggregation/02.4-api-endpoints-f001.md`

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Generate API Service:**
    *   Generate a new service (e.g., `ContractApiService`) using the Angular CLI: `ng generate service services/contract-api`.
    *   Ensure the service is created with `providedIn: 'root'` for a single, application-wide instance.
    *   Inject `HttpClient` using the `inject()` function: `private http = inject(HttpClient);`.
*   [ ] **Define Data Interfaces:**
    *   **(Pre-Mortem v2 Recommendation) Plan for Automated Client Generation:** Before manually creating interfaces, strongly consider creating a separate task to automate the generation of TypeScript interfaces and API client code from the backend's OpenAPI specification. This is a critical mitigation against data contract drift.
    *   If proceeding manually for this initial task, define TypeScript interfaces for the request parameters and response data structures.
    *   **CRITICAL:** These interfaces MUST strictly align with the Pydantic schemas and API endpoint definitions found in the authoritative backend documents. The backend is the single source of truth.
        *   **Pydantic Schemas:** `/plans/implementation/phase-02-backend-f001-public-contract-aggregation/02.2-data-models-f001.md`
        *   **API Endpoints:** `/plans/implementation/phase-02-backend-f001-public-contract-aggregation/02.4-api-endpoints-f001.md`
*   [ ] **Implement State Management:**
    *   **(Pre-Mortem v2 Recommendation)** To avoid boilerplate and bugs in consuming components, services **must not** simply return raw `Observable<T>`. Instead, they **must** manage the `AsyncState` (loading, data, error) internally and expose it via a `Signal`.
    *   Define a state interface, e.g., `interface ContractApiState { contracts: ShipContract[]; loading: boolean; error: string | null; }`.
    *   Expose this state as a writeable `Signal`: `state = signal<ContractApiState>({ contracts: [], loading: false, error: null });`.
*   [ ] **Implement Data Fetching Method:**
    *   Create a public method (e.g., `getContracts(params: ...)`). This method will trigger the HTTP request and update the state.
    *   The method must read the `apiUrl` from the environment files (defined in Task 03.0).
    *   Use RxJS operators (`tap`, `catchError`, `finalize`) to update the state signal during the request lifecycle (e.g., set `loading: true` on start, update `contracts` on success, set `error` on failure, set `loading: false` on completion).
*   [ ] **Implement Error Handling:**
    *   Use the `catchError` operator to handle `HttpErrorResponse`.
    *   Log the detailed error for debugging, adhering to the observability spec.
    *   Update the state signal's `error` property with a user-friendly message.
    *   **(Pre-Mortem v2 Recommendation)** The priority of implementing a global `HttpInterceptor` for error handling should be elevated. The interceptor is critical for transforming raw technical errors into a user-friendly state (e.g., via a notification service) and preventing the application from appearing broken when the backend is unavailable. This can be planned for a subsequent task, but is a high-priority follow-up.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   **Core Principles:**
    *   **Strong Typing:** Use strongly-typed interfaces for all API request and response objects. Avoid `any`.
    *   **Focused Services:** Keep API services focused on a single resource type. If the API grows, consider creating separate services for different resources to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
    *   **Environment-Sourced Config:** Ensure the `apiUrl` is always correctly sourced from the environment files.
*   **Modern Practices & State Management:**
    *   Utilize the `inject()` function for dependency injection (e.g., `inject(HttpClient)`).
    *   **(Pre-Mortem v2 Recommendation)** To avoid boilerplate and bugs in consuming components, services **should not** simply return raw `Observable<T>`. Instead, they **must** manage the `AsyncState` (loading, data, error) internally and expose it via a `Signal`. This provides a clean, consistent, and simple interface for all consumers.
    *   Adhere to RxJS best practices for stream manipulation and error handling (`/design/angular/guides/04-state-management-and-rxjs.md`).
*   **Scalability:** To prevent flooding the backend with requests from rapid user actions (e.g., fast pagination, typing in a search box), implement request management patterns. Use `switchMap` to cancel previous, outdated requests when a new one is initiated. Consider `debounceTime` for input-driven queries.
*   **API Prompt (Use as a starting point, but always verify against backend specs):**

    "Generate TypeScript interfaces for an Angular API service. **Note to Implementer:** Verify all fields and types against the authoritative backend specifications linked in the implementation plan.

    1.  `ShipContract`: Based on the `ShipContractRead` Pydantic schema.
    2.  `PaginatedShipContractsResponse`: A generic pagination wrapper.
    3.  `ShipContractsRequestParams`: For query parameters.

    Then, generate an Angular service method `getShipContracts` that uses `HttpClient`. This method should:
    - Make a GET request to `[apiUrl]/api/v1/contracts/ships`.
    - Accept an optional `params: ShipContractsRequestParams` object.
    - Construct `HttpParams` from the `params` object, ensuring undefined/null parameters are omitted.
    - Not return the `Observable` directly, but use it to update the internal state `Signal`."

*   **State Management:** The service is the owner of the async state. Components should not have to manage loading/error states themselves; they should simply read the service's state signal.
*   **RxJS Operators:** Use `switchMap` in methods that can be called multiple times in quick succession (e.g., search, pagination) to cancel previous, pending requests and avoid race conditions.
*   **Type Safety:** Always use strongly-typed interfaces for API requests and responses. Avoid `any`.
*   **Immutability:** When updating the state signal, always produce a new state object (`this.state.update(current => ({ ...current, loading: true }));`) to ensure change detection works as expected.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns will be addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** The implementation must ensure API calls use HTTPS by configuring `apiUrl` in `environment.prod.ts` appropriately.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** N/A. The backend is responsible for input validation; this service only consumes the API.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** The implementation will rely on Angular's default XSS protections for any data that might be displayed from this service.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. This task does not cover authenticated routes.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** The implementation must confirm that no secrets are stored in the service or related configurations.
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** The implementation will rely on the core `HttpClient` provider. No new third-party dependencies will be introduced.
*   **Notes:** The plan requires that user-facing error messages derived from this service must not leak sensitive backend details.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** The implementation must use structured logging (e.g., `console.debug`, `console.error`) for key events, with a view to integrate a more formal logging library later.
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** The implementation must log the initiation of API calls (e.g., `console.debug('Fetching ship contracts with params:', params)`) and their success or failure outcomes.
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** The implementation must log API errors comprehensively in the `catchError` block, including request context.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A. This is not required for the initial setup.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A. This is not required for this task.
*   **Notes:** Logging will use the browser's `console` object but must be formatted to provide clear context. Adhere to `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** The implementation must include unit tests for the API service using `HttpClientTestingModule` to mock responses and verify service logic.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** N/A. This service will be tested as part of the integration tests of the components that consume it.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** The goal is to achieve high unit test coverage for the service's logic, including parameter handling and state updates.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** The tests will require mock data for API request parameters and response payloads, which will be defined within the spec file.
*   **Notes:** Testing must thoroughly cover success, error, and loading states. Test cases must also simulate backend responses with `null` or missing optional fields to ensure graceful handling. Adhere to `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** N/A. This is a non-UI service.
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A.
*   [x] **Color Contrast:** N/A.
*   [x] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A.
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** Not applicable to a non-UI backend API service. Accessibility for data presented from this service is the responsibility of consuming UI components.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [x] **Text Abstraction:** N/A. This service does not contain user-facing text.
*   [x] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A.
*   [x] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** The implementation must ensure the service correctly handles API responses assuming UTF-8 encoding.
*   **Notes:** Not directly applicable to this service. Any user-facing text derived from this service (e.g., error messages) must be handled by UI components according to i18n best practices as per `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`.
