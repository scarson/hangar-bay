# Task 03.2: Backend API Service Layer

## 1. Objective

To create a dedicated Angular service (e.g., `ContractApiService`) responsible for communicating with the backend FastAPI. This service will be provided by the `CoreModule` (established in Task 03.0). This task includes setting up `HttpClientModule` (if not already in `CoreModule`), defining base API URL from environment configuration, and creating initial methods for fetching data related to F001.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Frontend Architecture, API Communication)
*   Task 00.2: Configuration Management (Angular `environment.ts` for `apiUrl`)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Backend endpoints to call)
*   [Task 03.0: Angular Core Module Setup](./03.0-angular-core-module-setup.md) (The API service will be part of `CoreModule`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Import `HttpClientModule`:**
    *   Import `HttpClientModule` into `CoreModule` (from Task 03.0) as it's a common dependency for services provided by Core.
    *   **AI Prompt (Optional):** "Show how to import `HttpClientModule` into an Angular `CoreModule`."
*   [ ] **Create API Service(s):**
    *   Generate a new Angular service using the CLI (e.g., `ng generate service core/services/contracts`).
    *   This service should be provided in `CoreModule`'s `providers` array (or use `providedIn: 'root'` if preferred, but for this phase, explicit provision in `CoreModule` is acceptable).
    *   Inject `HttpClient` into the service, preferably using the `inject(HttpClient)` function as per `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#8.1`.
*   [ ] **Utilize Base API URL from Environment Files:**
    *   The API service must read the `apiUrl` property from Angular's environment files (e.g., `import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';`).
    *   This `apiUrl` property should have been defined in both `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` during Task 03.1.
    *   The service will use this `apiUrl` to prefix all backend API calls (e.g., `${environment.apiUrl}/contracts/ships`).
*   [ ] **Implement Initial API Methods:**
    *   Based on the backend API endpoint from Task 02.4 (`GET /api/v1/contracts/ships`), create an initial method in the service to fetch ship contracts.
    *   Define TypeScript interfaces for the request parameters and response data structures. **CRITICAL: These interfaces MUST strictly align with the Pydantic schemas defined in the backend (Task 02.2 for `ShipContractRead`) and query parameters specified in API endpoints (Task 02.4).** Backend definitions are the single source of truth. Also consider learnings from Phase 0 (e.g., nullable fields, date formats).
    *   Example method: `getShipContracts(params?: ShipContractsRequestParams): Observable<PaginatedShipContractsResponse>`
    *   [ ] **Verify Interface and Parameter Alignment:** Before coding, meticulously compare the TypeScript interface fields/types and request parameter names suggested in the AI prompt below against the authoritative Pydantic schemas in Task 02.2 and API endpoint definitions in Task 02.4. Prioritize backend specifications in case of any discrepancy.
    *   **AI Prompt (Use as a starting point, verify against backend specs):** "Generate TypeScript interfaces for an Angular API service:
        *   **Note to Implementer:** The following field names and types are illustrative. Always verify against the definitive Pydantic schemas in Task 02.2 (for response models like `ShipContract`) and API endpoint definitions in Task 02.4 (for request parameters like `ShipContractsRequestParams`). Backend specifications are the source of truth.
        1.  `ShipContract`: Based on F001 `ShipContractRead` Pydantic schema. Key fields:
            *   `contract_id: number`
            *   `title?: string | null`
            *   `price?: number | null`
            *   `status: string`
            *   `date_issued: string` (ISO 8601 date string)
            *   `date_expired: string` (ISO 8601 date string)
            *   `start_location_name?: string | null`
            *   `ship_type_id: number`
            *   `ship_name: string`
            *   `is_blueprint_copy?: boolean | null`
            *   `runs?: number | null`
            *   `material_efficiency?: number | null`
            *   `time_efficiency?: number | null`
        2.  `PaginatedShipContractsResponse`: A generic pagination wrapper.
            *   `items: ShipContract[]`
            *   `total: number`
            *   `page: number`
            *   `size: number`
            *   `pages: number`
        3.  `ShipContractsRequestParams`: For query parameters.
            *   `page?: number`
            *   `size?: number`
            *   `ship_type_id?: number`
            *   `is_bpc?: boolean`

        Then, generate an Angular service method `getShipContracts` that uses `HttpClient`. This method should:
        - Make a GET request to `[apiUrl]/api/v1/contracts/ships`.
        - Accept an optional `params: ShipContractsRequestParams` object for query parameters.
        - Construct `HttpParams` from the `params` object, ensuring undefined/null parameters are omitted. **Clarification Point:** For boolean parameters (e.g., `is_bpc`), consult Task 02.4 or the backend API specification to determine if `false` values should be explicitly sent (e.g., `is_bpc=false`) or omitted.
        - Return an `Observable<PaginatedShipContractsResponse>`."
    *   **Note on Reactive Data:** Consider how data fetched by this service will be managed and exposed reactively. For state derived from API responses that needs to be shared or observed, Angular Signals are the preferred approach as outlined in `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#6.2`.
*   [ ] **Error Handling Strategy (Initial):**
    *   Implement a basic error handling approach for API calls using the RxJS `catchError` operator. This should, at a minimum:
    *   Log the detailed error object (e.g., `HttpErrorResponse`) for debugging purposes (see Observability section below, and refer to `../../../design/observability-spec.md` for structured logging guidance).
    *   Transform the error into a form that can be gracefully handled by the calling component (e.g., an `Observable` emitting a custom error object or `null`) or re-throw a new error with relevant context. Avoid directly exposing raw `HttpErrorResponse` objects to the UI layer if they contain sensitive information.
    *   Follow RxJS best practices for error handling in streams (see `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#5.6`).
*   A more robust, global error handler (e.g., using an `HttpInterceptor` and potentially a dedicated error handling service) can be planned for a later task to centralize common error handling logic, such as reporting to an error tracking service or displaying standardized user notifications.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use strong typing for API request and response objects.
*   Leverage RxJS operators for handling asynchronous data streams from `HttpClient`.
*   Keep API services focused; consider separate services for different resource types if the API grows complex.
*   Ensure the `apiUrl` is correctly sourced from environment files.
*   **Modern Practices:**
    *   Utilize the `inject()` function for dependency injection (e.g., `inject(HttpClient)`).
    *   If the service manages or exposes reactive state derived from API calls, prefer Angular Signals (see `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#6.1` and `#6.2`).
    *   Adhere to RxJS best practices for stream manipulation and error handling (`../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#5`).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   `HttpClientModule` is imported and available.
*   An Angular service for backend communication is created and provided via `CoreModule` (or `providedIn: 'root'`).
*   The service uses `apiUrl` from environment files.
*   Initial methods for fetching contract data (as per F001 backend API) are implemented with appropriate TypeScript types.
*   Basic error handling consideration is in place for API calls.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** Ensure API calls use HTTPS by configuring `apiUrl` in `environment.prod.ts` appropriately.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A for frontend service making calls; backend handles input validation. Frontend should sanitize parameters if constructed from user input not yet typed.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** Angular's `HttpClient` and data binding handle XSS prevention for responses by default when displaying data.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A for initial public API calls. Will be relevant when authenticated endpoints are added.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** `apiUrl` is configuration, not a secret. No direct secrets handled by this service.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** `HttpClientModule` is a core Angular module. No new external dependencies for this service itself.
*   **Notes:** Ensure error messages from API displayed to user do not leak sensitive backend information.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** Plan for structured logging. Initial implementation may use `console.debug/error` with consistent formatting, with a view to integrate a more formal logging library later if needed.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** Log initiation of API calls (e.g., `console.debug('Fetching ship contracts with params:', params)`) and successful/failed outcomes.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Log API call errors comprehensively in the `catchError` block (e.g., `console.error('API Error fetching [resource]:', error)`), including request context if possible.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A for initial setup, but plan for future integration via an `HttpInterceptor` if cross-service tracing becomes necessary.
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A for this task (e.g., API call duration, error rates could be future metrics).
*   **Notes:** Adhere to `../../../design/observability-spec.md`. Initial logging will use `console` but should be structured enough to convey context. (Ref: Phase 0 Review - Observability)

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Create unit tests for the API service methods using `HttpClientTestingModule` and `HttpTestingController` to mock HTTP responses and verify requests.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** N/A for this service alone; will be part of component integration tests.
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** Aim for high unit test coverage for the API service logic, including parameter handling and response mapping.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** Define mock request parameters and response data within the spec files for tests.
*   **Notes:** Thoroughly test parameter construction, response mapping, and error handling paths. Adhere to `../../../design/test-spec.md`. (Ref: Phase 0 Review - Testing)

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** N/A
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** N/A
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A
*   **Notes:** Not directly applicable to a non-UI backend API service. Accessibility for data presented from this service will be handled by the consuming UI components as per `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** N/A
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Ensure service handles API responses assuming UTF-8 (standard for JSON APIs).
*   **Notes:** Not directly applicable to a non-UI backend API service. Any user-facing text, including error messages derived from this service's operations and displayed by UI components, will be handled by those components according to i18n best practices as per `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`.
