# Task 03.0: Angular Project Initialization

## 1. Objective

Initialize a new Angular v20+ project using the Angular CLI, establishing a modern, **standalone**, and **i18n-ready** foundation for the Hangar Bay frontend application.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/angular/00-angular-architecture-overview.md`
*   `/design/angular/01-angular-style-guide.md`
*   `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`
*   `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md` (Initial considerations for `index.html`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [x] **Install/Update Angular CLI & Dependencies:**
    *   Ensure the latest stable version of the Angular CLI is installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).
    *   Install code quality dependencies: `npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`.
*   [x] **Create New Standalone Angular Workspace:**
    *   From the project's root directory, run `ng new` with the `--standalone`, `--strict`, `--routing`, and `--style=scss` flags.
        ```bash
        # Run from the root of the hangar-bay repository
        ng new app --directory app --routing --style=scss --strict --standalone
        ```
*   [x] **Configure Linting, Formatting, and Component Prefix:**
    *   Create a `.prettierrc.json` file in the new `app/` directory with standard project settings.
    *   In `app/.eslintrc.json`, add `'prettier'` and `plugin:prettier/recommended` to the `extends` array to ensure compatibility.
    *   Add `lint` and `format` scripts to `app/package.json`.
    *   In `app/angular.json`, set the project's component prefix to `hgb`.
*   [x] **Install & Configure i18n:**
    *   Navigate into the `app/` directory and run `ng add @angular/localize`.
    *   In `angular.json`, add the `i18n` block to the `build` configuration to define the source locale (`en-US`).
*   [x] **Configure Global Styles:**
    *   Locate `app/src/styles.scss`.
    *   Establish a basic structure for global styles, such as adding a CSS reset or defining root CSS variables for theme colors and fonts.
*   [x] **Configure Environment Files & Runtime Verification:**
    *   Open `app/src/environments/environment.ts` and add the `apiUrl`. Example: `export const environment = { production: false, apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1' };`.
    *   Open `app/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` and add the `apiUrl`. Example: `export const environment = { production: true, apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1' };`.
    *   **(Pre-Mortem v2)** Add a runtime check in `app/src/main.ts` to log a catastrophic error if the `apiUrl` is missing or invalid in a production build (`if (environment.production && (!environment.apiUrl || environment.apiUrl.includes('localhost'))) { ... }`).
*   [x] **Establish Shared Directory Structure:**
    *   Create a directory `app/src/app/shared/` to house future reusable, standalone components, directives, and pipes, in alignment with the project architecture.
*   [x] **Verify Initial Setup:**
    *   Run `ng serve` from the `app/` directory and verify the default application loads at `http://localhost:4200`.
    *   Run the `lint` and `format` scripts to ensure they execute correctly.
*   [x] **Initial Commit:**
    *   Commit the newly generated and configured project files to version control to establish a clean baseline.
    *   Open `app/frontend/angular/src/environments/environment.ts` (created by `ng new`). By default, it contains `export const environment = { production: false };`.
    *   Modify it to include `apiUrl`. Example for development: `export const environment = { production: false, apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1' };`.
    *   Open `app/frontend/angular/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`. By default, it contains `export const environment = { production: true };`.
    *   Modify it to include `apiUrl`. Example for production (actual URL TBD): `export const environment = { production: true, apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1' };`.
    *   **Note:** The actual production URL will be finalized later. Use a clear placeholder if the final URL is not yet known. This step ensures the property exists for type-safe access.
*   [x] **Add Runtime Verification for Production `apiUrl`:**
    *   As a risk mitigation measure (see pre-mortem v2), add a simple runtime check in `main.ts` or `app.component.ts` to validate the production `apiUrl`. This check should log a catastrophic error if the URL is missing, malformed, or points to a `localhost` address in a production build (`if (environment.production && (!environment.apiUrl || environment.apiUrl.includes('localhost'))) { ... }`).
*   [x] **Verify Application Runs:**
    *   Run the `lint` and `format` scripts to ensure they execute correctly.
    *   Run `ng serve` and ensure the default Angular application page loads in the browser.## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use the Angular CLI for generating all code (`ng g ...`) to maintain consistency.
*   The `--standalone` flag is critical for all generated components, directives, and pipes.
*   The `--strict` flag, used during project creation, is essential for catching errors early.
*   Ensure Prettier and ESLint configurations are compatible to avoid conflicts.
*   Use a custom component prefix (e.g., `hgb`) in `angular.json` to avoid naming collisions.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [x] A new standalone, strict Angular application is generated with SCSS and routing.
*   [x] ESLint and Prettier are configured, *demonstrably work together without conflicts (e.g., format on save behaves, `npm run lint` and `npm run format` execute cleanly)* and integrated into `package.json` scripts.
*   [x] The custom component prefix (`hgb`) is configured and verified in `angular.json`.
*   [x] `@angular/localize` is installed and configured in `angular.json`.
*   [x] Basic global style structure is established in `styles.scss`.
*   [x] The `apiUrl` property is defined in both environment files, and a runtime verification check is in place for production builds.
*   [x] The default application runs, and all lint/format scripts execute cleanly.
*   [x] All new files and configurations are committed to version control.
*   [x] The Cross-Cutting Concerns Review (Section 7) for this task is completed with appropriate forward-looking statements.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** The project was initialized using secure defaults from the latest Angular framework version.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** N/A. This task does not create any components that accept user input.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** N/A. This task does not create any components that display dynamic data.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. This task does not involve authentication or authorization.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** Confirmed that `environment.ts` files are used only for non-sensitive configuration (`apiUrl`).
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** Ran `npm audit` and confirmed there are 0 vulnerabilities in the initial dependency tree.
*   **Notes:** Security posture is solid for an initial setup, leveraging framework defaults and verifying the dependency tree. The runtime check for the production `apiUrl` in `main.ts` adds a layer of defense against misconfiguration.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** N/A. This foundational task does not implement specific logging features.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** N/A.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Angular's default console error logging is in place. The runtime `apiUrl` check provides a critical, loud failure signal for misconfigurations.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** This task is foundational. Observability for specific application features will be addressed in subsequent tasks.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** The default `AppComponent` unit test was verified to pass using `ng test`.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** The runtime `apiUrl` validation in `main.ts` serves as a critical, automated check, fulfilling the risk-mitigation intent for this setup task.
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** Verified that coverage reports are generated successfully by running `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage` and confirming the creation of the `/coverage` directory.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** N/A for this task.
*   **Notes:** The testing framework is correctly initialized, and key verification steps (unit tests, coverage) are confirmed to be working.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Verified that `index.html` has the correct `lang="en"` attribute and basic semantic structure.
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A for the default, non-interactive app shell.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   [x] **Color Contrast:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   [x] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   **Notes:** Verified that `index.html` includes `<meta charset="utf-8">` and `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`, establishing a solid baseline for accessibility.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [x] **Text Abstraction:** The core setup was completed via `ng add @angular/localize`. N/A for this task as no user-facing text was created.
*   [x] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A for the skeleton project.
*   [x] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A for the skeleton project.
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Verified that the generated `index.html` includes `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
*   **Notes:** The foundational setup for i18n is complete. This enables all subsequent tasks to correctly implement i18n by marking strings with the `i18n` attribute.
