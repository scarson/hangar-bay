# Task 03.0: Angular Project Initialization

## 1. Objective

To initialize a new Angular application using the Angular CLI, set up the basic project structure, configure SCSS for styling, establish initial linting/formatting rules, set a custom component prefix, configure environment files, and create an initial SharedModule. This task lays the foundational workspace for subsequent Angular development.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: Technology Stack, Frontend Architecture)
*   `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md` (Initial considerations for accessible component structure)
*   Task 00.1: Project Initialization & Tooling (for ESLint, Prettier setup if shared or analogous)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Install Angular CLI:**
    *   Ensure Angular CLI is installed globally or use `npx @angular/cli`.
*   [ ] **Prepare Frontend Directory and Generate Application:**
    1.  Ensure the target parent directory `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\` exists. (Create it if it doesn't: `mkdir app` from the project root `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\`)
    2.  Navigate into it: `cd c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\`
    3.  Run `ng new frontend --style=scss --routing=true --strict=true --standalone=false --prefix=hgb`.
        *   This will create the Angular project at `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\frontend\`.
        *   The Angular application name within `angular.json` will be `frontend`.
*   [ ] **Verify Component Prefix in `angular.json`:**
    *   Open `angular.json` (located at the Angular project root, e.g., `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\frontend\angular.json`).
    *   Confirm that under `projects.frontend.prefix` (or your app name if different), the value is `hgb`.
*   [ ] **Initial Project Structure Review:**
    *   Familiarize with the generated Angular project structure (e.g., `app/frontend/src/`, `app/frontend/src/app/`, `app/frontend/src/assets/`, `app/frontend/src/environments/`).
*   [ ] **Linting and Formatting Setup (within `app/frontend/` directory):**
    *   Angular CLI includes ESLint. Review its configuration (`app/frontend/.eslintrc.json`).
    *   [ ] **Install Linting/Formatting Dev Dependencies:**
        *   Run `npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier` (or `pnpm add -D ...`) from within the Angular project directory (e.g., `app/frontend/`).
    *   [ ] **Configure Prettier:** Create a `.prettierrc.json` file in the Angular project root (e.g., `app/frontend/.prettierrc.json`) with preferred settings.
        *   **AI Prompt:** "Provide a good default `.prettierrc.json` configuration (e.g., single quotes, trailing commas, print width)."
    *   [ ] **Configure ESLint for Prettier Integration:**
        *   In `app/frontend/.eslintrc.json`, add `'prettier'` and potentially `plugin:prettier/recommended` to the `extends` array (usually as the last items). Ensure there are no rule conflicts.
        *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to modify an Angular generated `.eslintrc.json` to correctly integrate `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier`."
    *   [ ] **Add/Verify npm scripts** in `app/frontend/package.json` for linting and formatting (e.g., `"lint": "ng lint"`, `"format": "prettier --write ./**/*.{ts,html,scss,json,md}"`).
        *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example `package.json` script section for an Angular project to run ESLint and Prettier, covering relevant file types."
*   [ ] **Global Styles Setup:**
    *   Locate `app/frontend/src/styles.scss`.
    *   Plan for basic global style resets or a base theme structure (e.g., variables for colors, typography). For now, ensure it's usable.
*   [ ] **Configure `apiUrl` in Environment Files:**
    *   Open `app/frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` (created by `ng new`). By default, it contains `export const environment = { production: false };`.
    *   Modify it to include `apiUrl`. Example for development: `export const environment = { production: false, apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1' };`.
    *   Open `app/frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`. By default, it contains `export const environment = { production: true };`.
    *   Modify it to include `apiUrl`. Example for production (actual URL TBD): `export const environment = { production: true, apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1' };`.
    *   **Note:** The actual production URL will be finalized later. Use a clear placeholder if the final URL is not yet known. This step ensures the property exists for type-safe access.
*   [ ] **Generate Initial `SharedModule`:**
    *   From the Angular project root directory (e.g., `app\frontend\` from the Hangar Bay project root), run: `ng generate module shared`.
    *   This command will create the module at `app/frontend/src/app/shared/shared.module.ts`.
    *   This module will initially be empty but establishes the place for future reusable components, directives, and pipes.
*   [ ] **Verify Application Runs:**
    *   Run `ng serve` and ensure the default Angular application page loads in the browser.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use the Angular CLI for generating components, services, etc., to maintain consistency.
*   Enable strict mode in Angular for better type checking and catching errors early.
*   Ensure Prettier and ESLint configurations are compatible to avoid conflicts.
*   Use a custom component prefix (e.g., `hgb`) for all generated components to avoid naming collisions with third-party libraries.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   A new Angular application is generated with SCSS and routing.
*   ESLint and Prettier are configured, *demonstrably work together without conflicts (e.g., format on save behaves, `npm run lint` and `npm run format` execute cleanly)*, and are integrated into npm scripts in `app/frontend/package.json`.
*   Basic global style structure in `styles.scss` is considered (e.g., CSS resets, global font settings).
*   Custom component prefix (e.g., `hgb`) is configured *and verified* in `angular.json` (e.g., in `app/frontend/angular.json`).
*   An initial (empty) `SharedModule` (`shared.module.ts`) is created in `app/frontend/src/app/shared/`.
*   The default Angular application runs successfully using `ng serve`.
*   The `apiUrl` property is defined in both `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`.
*   All new files and configurations are committed to version control.
*   Cross-Cutting Concerns Review (Section 7) for this task is completed.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** N/A (Application skeleton setup)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** Angular `environment.ts` files are for non-sensitive configuration. Ensure no secrets are hardcoded.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** `ng new` creates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Run `npm audit` after generation to check for known vulnerabilities in initial dependencies.
*   **Notes:** Focus on secure defaults provided by Angular CLI. Ensure `environment.prod.ts` does not contain debug flags or sensitive developer information.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A for skeleton.
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** N/A for skeleton.
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** Angular's default console error logging will be present. No custom setup in this task.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A
*   **Notes:** Foundational. Observability for specific features will be added later.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Angular CLI (`ng new`) sets up Karma and Jasmine, and generates basic unit tests for `AppComponent`. These should pass.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** N/A for skeleton.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** Initial coverage reports can be generated via `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage`.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** N/A
*   **Notes:** This task ensures the testing framework is initialized. Writing comprehensive tests will be part of subsequent tasks.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Review default `index.html` for basic structure (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `lang` attribute). Ensure `lang="en"` is set or appropriate default.
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A for default skeleton beyond browser defaults.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   **Notes:** Ensure `index.html` has `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`. Basic a11y considerations for the generated app shell.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A for default skeleton.
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Angular defaults to UTF-8. Verify `index.html` has `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
*   **Notes:** Foundational. I18n setup (e.g., `@angular/localize`) is a separate, later task if needed.
