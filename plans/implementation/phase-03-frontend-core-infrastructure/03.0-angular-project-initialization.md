# Task 03.0: Angular Project Initialization

## 1. Objective

Initialize a new Angular v20+ project using the Angular CLI, establishing a modern, **standalone**, and **i18n-ready** foundation for the Hangar Bay frontend application.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/angular/00-angular-architecture-overview.md`
*   `/design/angular/01-angular-style-guide.md`
*   `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`
*   `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md` (Initial considerations for `index.html`)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Install/Update Angular CLI & Dependencies:**
    *   Ensure the latest stable version of the Angular CLI is installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`).
    *   Install code quality dependencies: `npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`.
*   [ ] **Create New Standalone Angular Workspace:**
    *   From the project's root directory, run `ng new` with the `--standalone`, `--strict`, `--routing`, and `--style=scss` flags.
        ```bash
        # Run from the root of the hangar-bay repository
        ng new app --directory app --routing --style=scss --strict --standalone
        ```
*   [ ] **Configure Linting, Formatting, and Component Prefix:**
    *   Create a `.prettierrc.json` file in the new `app/` directory with standard project settings.
    *   In `app/.eslintrc.json`, add `'prettier'` and `plugin:prettier/recommended` to the `extends` array to ensure compatibility.
    *   Add `lint` and `format` scripts to `app/package.json`.
    *   In `app/angular.json`, set the project's component prefix to `hgb`.
*   [ ] **Install & Configure i18n:**
    *   Navigate into the `app/` directory and run `ng add @angular/localize`.
    *   In `angular.json`, add the `i18n` block to the `build` configuration to define the source locale (`en-US`).
*   [ ] **Configure Global Styles:**
    *   Locate `app/src/styles.scss`.
    *   Establish a basic structure for global styles, such as adding a CSS reset or defining root CSS variables for theme colors and fonts.
*   [ ] **Configure Environment Files & Runtime Verification:**
    *   Open `app/src/environments/environment.ts` and add the `apiUrl`. Example: `export const environment = { production: false, apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1' };`.
    *   Open `app/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` and add the `apiUrl`. Example: `export const environment = { production: true, apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1' };`.
    *   **(Pre-Mortem v2)** Add a runtime check in `app/src/main.ts` to log a catastrophic error if the `apiUrl` is missing or invalid in a production build (`if (environment.production && (!environment.apiUrl || environment.apiUrl.includes('localhost'))) { ... }`).
*   [ ] **Establish Shared Directory Structure:**
    *   Create a directory `app/src/app/shared/` to house future reusable, standalone components, directives, and pipes, in alignment with the project architecture.
*   [ ] **Verify Initial Setup:**
    *   Run `ng serve` from the `app/` directory and verify the default application loads at `http://localhost:4200`.
    *   Run the `lint` and `format` scripts to ensure they execute correctly.
*   [ ] **Initial Commit:**
    *   Commit the newly generated and configured project files to version control to establish a clean baseline.
    *   Open `app/frontend/angular/src/environments/environment.ts` (created by `ng new`). By default, it contains `export const environment = { production: false };`.
    *   Modify it to include `apiUrl`. Example for development: `export const environment = { production: false, apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1' };`.
    *   Open `app/frontend/angular/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`. By default, it contains `export const environment = { production: true };`.
    *   Modify it to include `apiUrl`. Example for production (actual URL TBD): `export const environment = { production: true, apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1' };`.
    *   **Note:** The actual production URL will be finalized later. Use a clear placeholder if the final URL is not yet known. This step ensures the property exists for type-safe access.
*   [ ] **Add Runtime Verification for Production `apiUrl`:**
    *   As a risk mitigation measure (see pre-mortem v2), add a simple runtime check in `main.ts` or `app.component.ts` to validate the production `apiUrl`. This check should log a catastrophic error if the URL is missing, malformed, or points to a `localhost` address in a production build (`if (environment.production && (!environment.apiUrl || environment.apiUrl.includes('localhost'))) { ... }`).
*   [ ] **Verify Application Runs:**
    *   Run the `lint` and `format` scripts to ensure they execute correctly.
    *   Run `ng serve` and ensure the default Angular application page loads in the browser.## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use the Angular CLI for generating all code (`ng g ...`) to maintain consistency.
*   The `--standalone` flag is critical for all generated components, directives, and pipes.
*   The `--strict` flag, used during project creation, is essential for catching errors early.
*   Ensure Prettier and ESLint configurations are compatible to avoid conflicts.
*   Use a custom component prefix (e.g., `hgb`) in `angular.json` to avoid naming collisions.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [ ] A new standalone, strict Angular application is generated with SCSS and routing.
*   [ ] ESLint and Prettier are configured, *demonstrably work together without conflicts (e.g., format on save behaves, `npm run lint` and `npm run format` execute cleanly)* and integrated into `package.json` scripts.
*   [ ] The custom component prefix (`hgb`) is configured and verified in `angular.json`.
*   [ ] `@angular/localize` is installed and configured in `angular.json`.
*   [ ] Basic global style structure is established in `styles.scss`.
*   [ ] The `apiUrl` property is defined in both environment files, and a runtime verification check is in place for production builds.
*   [ ] The default application runs, and all lint/format scripts execute cleanly.
*   [ ] All new files and configurations are committed to version control.
*   [ ] The Cross-Cutting Concerns Review (Section 7) for this task is completed with appropriate forward-looking statements.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** The plan relies on the secure defaults provided by the modern Angular framework. No custom security-sensitive logic is being introduced in this task.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** N/A. This task does not create any components that accept user input.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** N/A. This task does not create any components that display dynamic data.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. This task does not involve authentication or authorization.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** The implementation must confirm that `environment.ts` files are used for non-sensitive configuration (`apiUrl`) only. A policy against storing secrets in these files will be established.
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** The `ng new` command creates `package.json`. The implementation must include running `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in the initial dependency tree.
*   **Notes:** The security approach for this task is to leverage framework defaults and establish correct configuration patterns (like no secrets in environment files) from the start.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** N/A. This foundational task does not implement specific logging features.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** Angular's default console error logging will be present. No custom observability setup is required for this task.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** This task is foundational. Observability for specific application features will be addressed in subsequent tasks.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** The Angular CLI (`ng new`) will set up Karma and Jasmine and generate a basic, passing unit test for `AppComponent`. This test must be run and verified.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** The plan requires adding a critical integration test to verify the runtime `apiUrl` validation, mitigating a key pre-mortem risk.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** The project must be configured to generate coverage reports via `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage`, and this script must be verified to work.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** N/A for this task.
*   **Notes:** This task's goal is to ensure the testing framework is correctly initialized and to implement one specific, risk-driven integration test as part of the setup.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** The implementation must review the default `index.html` to ensure it has the correct `lang="en"` attribute and basic semantic structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A for the default, non-interactive app shell.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   [x] **Color Contrast:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   [x] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A for the default app shell.
*   **Notes:** The plan requires verifying that `index.html` includes `<meta charset="utf-8">` and `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` to establish a baseline for accessibility.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** The core setup will be done via `ng add @angular/localize`. No user-facing text is created in this task, so no text requires abstraction.
*   [x] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A for the skeleton project.
*   [x] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A for the skeleton project.
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** The implementation must verify that the generated `index.html` includes `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
*   **Notes:** The foundational setup for i18n is the primary goal. This enables all subsequent tasks to correctly implement i18n by marking strings with the `i18n` attribute.
