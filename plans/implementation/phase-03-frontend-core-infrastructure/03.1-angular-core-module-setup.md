# Task 03.1: Angular Core Module Setup

## 1. Objective

To establish a foundational `CoreModule` in the Angular application created in Task 03.0. This module will be responsible for providing singleton services, exporting core layout components, and ensuring that core functionalities are initialized only once in the application. It also involves importing `CoreModule` into the root `AppModule`.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (Sections: Frontend Architecture)
*   [Task 03.0: Angular Project Initialization](./03.0-angular-project-initialization.md) (This task builds upon the project initialized in 03.0)
*   Angular Style Guide: Core Feature Module ([https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#core-feature-module](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#core-feature-module))
*   **Note on Shared Resources:** `CoreModule` is for singleton services and components used *once* in the app shell (e.g., `AppComponent`). Reusable UI components, pipes, and directives needed by multiple feature modules should reside in a separate `SharedModule` (created in Task 03.0).

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

**Prerequisite:** The Angular application skeleton (specifically the directory `app/frontend/`) must have been created as per **Task 03.0: Angular Project Initialization**.

*   [ ] **Generate `CoreModule` File:**
    *   Navigate to the Angular project's root directory (e.g., `c:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Documents\Code\hangar-bay\app\frontend\`).
    *   From this directory, run: `ng generate module core`.
    *   This command creates the module file at `src/app/core/core.module.ts` (relative to the CWD), resulting in an absolute path like `app/frontend/src/app/core/core.module.ts`.
*   [ ] **Import `HttpClientModule`:**
    *   Import `HttpClientModule` from `@angular/common/http` into the `imports` array of `CoreModule`. This is essential as `CoreModule` will provide API services that depend on `HttpClient`.
*   [ ] **Import `CommonModule`:**
    *   Import `CommonModule` from `@angular/common` into the `imports` array of `CoreModule`. This is generally required if `CoreModule` declares any components (like layout components planned in Task 03.3) that might use common Angular directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, pipes, `routerLinkActive`).
*   [ ] **Implement `CoreModule` Guard:**
    *   Create a constructor in `CoreModule` that injects `Optional` and `SkipSelf` decorated parent module to prevent re-importing the `CoreModule` in any module other than the root `AppModule`.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show an example of an Angular `CoreModule` constructor that uses `@Optional()` and `@SkipSelf()` decorators with `NgModule` to prevent re-importation into feature modules."
*   [ ] **Module Structure Planning:**
    *   Plan for subdirectories within `src/app/core/` such as `services/`, `components/` (for layout), `guards/`, `interceptors/` as needed.
*   [ ] **Identify Initial Core Components/Services:**
    *   The API service from Task 03.2 (`ContractApiService`) will be provided here. Services like `ContractApiService` should be designed with modern Angular practices in mind, such as using Angular Signals for reactive state management and `inject()` for dependency injection, as detailed in `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md`.
    *   Core layout components (Header, Footer from Task 03.3) will be declared and exported here.
*   [ ] **Integrate `CoreModule` into `AppModule`:**
    1.  Open `app.module.ts` (located at `app/frontend/src/app/app.module.ts`).
    2.  Import `CoreModule` from `./core/core.module`.
    3.  Add `CoreModule` to the `imports: []` array within the `@NgModule` decorator of `AppModule`.
    *   **AI Prompt (Optional):** "Show the code modifications needed in a default Angular `app.module.ts` to import and register a `CoreModule` from `./core/core.module`."
    *   **Note on `AppComponent` Design (as per `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md`):**
        *   If `AppComponent` or other initially generated components require dependency injection, prefer using the `inject()` function (see section `#8.1`).
        *   Plan for `AppComponent` to utilize `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for performance (see section `#3.3`).

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   **CRITICAL:** `CoreModule` MUST only be imported by the root `AppModule`. It MUST NOT be imported by any feature modules or shared modules. The import guard is designed to enforce this.
*   Services provided in `CoreModule` will be singletons available application-wide.
*   Components declared in `CoreModule` (like Header, Footer) should also be exported if they are used in `AppComponent`'s template.
*   Follow Angular best practices for module organization and the "providedIn: 'root'" vs. CoreModule provision for services (for this phase, providing in CoreModule is fine for clarity, can be refactored to `providedIn: 'root'` later if preferred for tree-shaking of services not used by CoreModule itself).
*   **Modern Practices for Services:** When services are provided by `CoreModule` (e.g., `ContractApiService` from Task 03.2):
        *   Prefer Angular Signals for managing and exposing reactive state (see `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#6.2`).
        *   Utilize the `inject()` function for dependency injection within these services for better type inference and readability (see `../../../design/angular-frontend-architecture.md#8.1`).
*   **Proactive Refactoring Planning:** If any artifacts initially placed in `CoreModule` are later identified as needing to be used by multiple feature modules, they should be refactored into the `SharedModule`.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** N/A (Module structure, not application logic with direct external exposure.)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** Angular CLI manages dependencies. No new external dependencies anticipated for `CoreModule` shell itself.
*   **Notes:** This task primarily sets up module structure. Security of services/components within `CoreModule` will be addressed in their respective tasks (03.2, 03.3).

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** N/A
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** N/A
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A
*   **Notes:** `CoreModule` itself doesn't introduce logging; services it contains might (addressed in Task 03.2).

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** [ ] (A simple unit test for the `CoreModule` constructor guard should be planned to ensure it throws if re-imported.)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** N/A (No direct integrations for the module shell itself.)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** N/A (Coverage will apply to contained services/components.)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** N/A
*   **Notes:** Testing will primarily focus on the services and components that `CoreModule` will eventually contain. For the `CoreModule` itself, the main testable aspect is the import guard. A dedicated unit test for the guard *should be planned* during this phase to verify it correctly prevents re-importation. This test can be implemented alongside the initial tests for services or components added to `CoreModule`.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** N/A
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** N/A
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** N/A
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** N/A
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A
*   **Notes:** This task is not UI-related. Accessibility of components managed by `CoreModule` will be addressed in Task 03.3.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** N/A
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Ensure file is UTF-8 (standard practice).
*   **Notes:** This task is not UI-related. I18n for components managed by `CoreModule` will be addressed in Task 03.3.
