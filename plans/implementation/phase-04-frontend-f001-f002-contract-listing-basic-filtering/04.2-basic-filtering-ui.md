# Task 04.2: Basic Filtering UI

**Phase:** 04 - Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To implement basic UI elements for filtering the displayed contract list. This includes filters for contract type (e.g., item exchange, auction) and region.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Specifies available filters)
*   `../../../design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (May provide context for filter design, though this task is for basic filters)
*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (UI/UX principles for filter controls)
*   Task 04.1: Contract List Component (Component to integrate filters with)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Backend API needs to support these filters)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Identify Basic Filters:**
    *   Based on F001, identify essential filters:
        *   Contract Type (e.g., 'item_exchange', 'auction', 'courier').
        *   Region ID (EVE Online region).
*   [ ] **Design Filter UI Elements:**
    *   Choose appropriate UI controls (e.g., dropdowns/selects for contract type and region).
    *   Place these filter controls near the `ContractListComponent` (e.g., above the list).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate HTML for an Angular component that includes a dropdown select for 'Contract Type' (options: Item Exchange, Auction, Courier) and another for 'Region' (options to be dynamically populated, but show a placeholder). Include a 'Apply Filters' button."
*   [ ] **Manage Filter State:**
    *   Use Angular forms (`FormsModule` or `ReactiveFormsModule`) to manage filter values.
    *   Store selected filter values in the component.
*   [ ] **Update API Calls:**
    *   Modify the `ContractListComponent` (or its API service call) to include selected filter parameters in the request to the backend.
    *   The backend API (Task 02.4) must be capable of handling these filter parameters.
*   [ ] **Trigger Data Refresh:**
    *   Re-fetch contract data when filters are applied (e.g., on button click or value change).
*   [ ] **Populate Region Filter (Dynamic Data):**
    *   Consider how region data (names and IDs) will be fetched for the region filter dropdown. This might involve a new API endpoint or a static list for MVP. For now, a placeholder or small static list is acceptable.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "If I have an API endpoint `/api/regions` that returns `[{id: 1, name: 'The Forge'}, ...]`, show how to populate an Angular Material `mat-select` with these regions in a component."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular's form capabilities for robust filter management.
*   Debounce filter input changes if applying filters automatically on change, to avoid excessive API calls. For MVP, a manual "Apply" button is simpler.
*   Ensure filter controls are accessible.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   UI elements for basic filtering (contract type, region) are added to the contract display area.
*   Selected filter values are used to query the backend API.
*   The contract list updates based on applied filters.
*   Filter state is managed within the component.
*   Region filter UI is implemented, using a placeholder or a small, static list of representative EVE Online regions for MVP.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 6.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 6.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 6.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 6.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider for any user-facing text including logs/error messages)*
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** (e.g., using translation keys instead of hardcoded strings)
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** (e.g., for dates, numbers, currencies)
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** (e.g., for text expansion in different languages)
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** (e.g., using UTF-8)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)
