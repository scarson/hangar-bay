# Task 04.2: Basic Filtering UI

**Phase:** 04 - Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To implement basic UI elements for filtering the displayed contract list. This includes filters for contract type (e.g., item exchange, auction) and region.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Specifies available filters)
*   `../../../design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md` (May provide context for filter design, though this task is for basic filters)
*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (UI/UX principles for filter controls)
*   Task 04.1: Contract List Component (Component to integrate filters with)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Backend API needs to support these filters)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Identify Basic Filters:**
    *   Based on F001, identify essential filters:
        *   Contract Type (e.g., 'item_exchange', 'auction', 'courier').
        *   Region ID (EVE Online region).
*   [ ] **Design Filter UI Elements:**
    *   Choose appropriate UI controls (e.g., dropdowns/selects for contract type and region).
    *   Place these filter controls near the `ContractListComponent` (e.g., above the list).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate HTML for an Angular component that includes a dropdown select for 'Contract Type' (options: Item Exchange, Auction, Courier) and another for 'Region' (options to be dynamically populated, but show a placeholder). Include a 'Apply Filters' button."
*   [ ] **Manage Filter State:**
    *   Use Angular forms (`FormsModule` or `ReactiveFormsModule`) to manage filter values.
    *   Store selected filter values in the component.
*   [ ] **Update API Calls:**
    *   Modify the `ContractListComponent` (or its API service call) to include selected filter parameters in the request to the backend.
    *   The backend API (Task 02.4) must be capable of handling these filter parameters.
*   [ ] **Trigger Data Refresh:**
    *   Re-fetch contract data when filters are applied (e.g., on button click or value change).
*   [ ] **Populate Region Filter (Dynamic Data):**
    *   Consider how region data (names and IDs) will be fetched for the region filter dropdown. This might involve a new API endpoint or a static list for MVP. For now, a placeholder or small static list is acceptable.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "If I have an API endpoint `/api/regions` that returns `[{id: 1, name: 'The Forge'}, ...]`, show how to populate an Angular Material `mat-select` with these regions in a component."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular's form capabilities for robust filter management.
*   Debounce filter input changes if applying filters automatically on change, to avoid excessive API calls. For MVP, a manual "Apply" button is simpler.
*   Ensure filter controls are accessible.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   UI elements for basic filtering (contract type, region) are added to the contract display area.
*   Selected filter values are used to query the backend API.
*   The contract list updates based on applied filters.
*   Filter state is managed within the component.
*   Consideration for populating region filter data is made.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
