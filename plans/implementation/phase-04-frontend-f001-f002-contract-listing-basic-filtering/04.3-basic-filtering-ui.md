# Task 04.3: Implement Contract Type Filter

## 1. Objective

To implement the full logic for filtering contracts by their `type` (e.g., 'Item Exchange', 'Auction'). This involves updating the data model, extending the state management service to handle the new filter parameter, adding the UI dropdown control, and connecting it to the component logic to trigger new API requests. This task will make the contract list interactive based on user-selected type.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `design/features/f002-contract-filtering.md`
*   `design/architecture/angular-frontend-architecture.md`
*   `app/frontend/angular/src/app/features/contracts/contract-search.ts` (for existing pattern)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Data Model (`contract.models.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 1.1:** Extend the `ContractSearchFilters` interface to include an optional `type` property.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "In `contract.models.ts`, add a new optional property `type?: string;` to the `ContractSearchFilters` interface."

### 3.2. State Management Service (`contract-search.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 2.1:** Update the RxJS pipeline in the `ContractSearch` service to include the `type` filter in the HTTP request.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "In `contract-search.ts`, modify the `switchMap` operator. If `filters.type` exists, add it as a query parameter named `type` to the `HttpParams`."

### 3.3. Component UI (`contract-browse-page.html`)

*   [x] **Step 3.1:** Add a dropdown (`<select>`) control to the filter panel for selecting the contract type.
*   [x] **Step 3.2:** Bind the dropdown's `(change)` event to a new handler method in the component.
*   [x] **Step 3.3:** Ensure the dropdown is styled consistently with the existing search input.

### 3.4. Component Logic (`contract-browse-page.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 4.1:** Create a new method `onTypeChange(event: Event)` in the `ContractBrowsePage` component.
*   [x] **Step 4.2:** This method should extract the selected value from the event target and call `this.contractSearch.updateFilters()`, passing the new type and resetting the page to 1.

### 3.5. Testing (`contract-search.spec.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 5.1:** Add a new test case to `contract-search.spec.ts` to verify that when `updateFilters` is called with a `type`, the subsequent API call includes the correct `type` query parameter.

### 3.6. Route Resolver (`contract-filter-resolver.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 6.1:** Update the `contractFilterResolver` to read the `type` query parameter from the `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`.
*   [x] **Step 6.2:** Add the `type` to the `filters` object passed to `contractSearch.setInitialFilters()`.

### 3.7. Resolver Testing (`contract-filter-resolver.spec.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 7.1:** Add a new test case to verify that the resolver correctly extracts the `type` parameter and passes it to `setInitialFilters`.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Follow the existing signal-based state management pattern in `ContractSearch`.
*   When updating filters, always reset the page to 1 to prevent users from being on a non-existent page of the new filtered results.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [x] **Implementation Complete:** All placeholder and scaffold code has been replaced with the final, working logic.
*   [x] The `ContractSearchFilters` interface now includes the optional `type` property.
*   [x] The `ContractSearch` service correctly adds the `type` query parameter to the API request when present.
*   [x] The `ContractBrowsePage` displays a functional dropdown for contract type.
*   [x] Selecting a type from the dropdown triggers a new, correctly filtered API request.
*   [x] A new unit test confirms the filtering logic in the service.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** N/A. UI-only task.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** N/A. No new user inputs that require validation logic in this task.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** This task is focused on UI layout and has no security implications.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** No new logic that would require observability.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** N/A. No new logic to test in this task.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** N/A. UI-only changes.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** Testing will be addressed in the next task when the filter logic is implemented.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Use `<label>` for the new select control.
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** N/A.
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** Ensure the new select control is keyboard navigable.
