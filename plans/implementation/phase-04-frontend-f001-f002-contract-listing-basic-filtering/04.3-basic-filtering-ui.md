# Task 04.3: Implement Contract Type Filter

## 1. Objective

To implement the full logic for filtering contracts by their `type` (e.g., 'Item Exchange', 'Auction'). This involves updating the data model, extending the state management service to handle the new filter parameter, adding the UI dropdown control, and connecting it to the component logic to trigger new API requests. This task will make the contract list interactive based on user-selected type.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `design/features/f002-contract-filtering.md`
*   `design/architecture/angular-frontend-architecture.md`
*   `app/frontend/angular/src/app/features/contracts/contract-search.ts` (for existing pattern)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Data Model (`contract.models.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 1.1:** Extend the `ContractSearchFilters` interface to include an optional `type` property.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "In `contract.models.ts`, add a new optional property `type?: string;` to the `ContractSearchFilters` interface."

### 3.2. State Management Service (`contract-search.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 2.1:** Update the RxJS pipeline in the `ContractSearch` service to include the `type` filter in the HTTP request.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "In `contract-search.ts`, modify the `switchMap` operator. If `filters.type` exists, add it as a query parameter named `type` to the `HttpParams`."

### 3.3. Component UI (`contract-browse-page.html`)

*   [x] **Step 3.1:** Add a dropdown (`<select>`) control to the filter panel for selecting the contract type.
*   [x] **Step 3.2:** Bind the dropdown's `(change)` event to a new handler method in the component.
*   [x] **Step 3.3:** Ensure the dropdown is styled consistently with the existing search input.

### 3.4. Component Logic (`contract-browse-page.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 4.1:** Create a new method `onTypeChange(event: Event)` in the `ContractBrowsePage` component.
*   [x] **Step 4.2:** This method should extract the selected value from the event target and call `this.contractSearch.updateFilters()`, passing the new type and resetting the page to 1.

### 3.5. Testing (`contract-search.spec.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 5.1:** Add a new test case to `contract-search.spec.ts` to verify that when `updateFilters` is called with a `type`, the subsequent API call includes the correct `type` query parameter.

### 3.6. Route Resolver (`contract-filter-resolver.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 6.1:** Update the `contractFilterResolver` to read the `type` query parameter from the `ActivatedRouteSnapshot`.
*   [x] **Step 6.2:** Add the `type` to the `filters` object passed to `contractSearch.setInitialFilters()`.

### 3.7. Resolver Testing (`contract-filter-resolver.spec.ts`)

*   [x] **Step 7.1:** Add a new test case to verify that the resolver correctly extracts the `type` parameter and passes it to `setInitialFilters`.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Follow the existing signal-based state management pattern in `ContractSearch`.
*   When updating filters, always reset the page to 1 to prevent users from being on a non-existent page of the new filtered results.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [x] **Implementation Complete:** All placeholder and scaffold code has been replaced with the final, working logic.
*   [x] The `ContractSearchFilters` interface now includes the optional `type` property.
*   [x] The `ContractSearch` service correctly adds the `type` query parameter to the API request when present.
*   [x] The `ContractBrowsePage` displays a functional dropdown for contract type.
*   [x] Selecting a type from the dropdown triggers a new, correctly filtered API request.
*   [x] A new unit test confirms the filtering logic in the service.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Challenge:** The task file was pre-marked as complete.
*   **Resolution:** A line-by-line verification was performed against the implementation plan. All code was found to be correctly implemented as specified, including data models, state management, UI, component logic, and comprehensive tests for all new logic.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** The filter value is handled by Angular's `HttpParams`, which prevents HTTP parameter injection attacks by properly encoding the value. Verified in `contract-search.ts`.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** The `type` filter is based on a `<select>` element with a fixed set of `<option>` values. This inherently validates the input to one of the allowed values, preventing arbitrary user input.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** Angular's default output encoding mechanisms protect against XSS from the filter value being reflected in the UI. No manual intervention was required.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. The public contracts endpoint does not require authentication or authorization.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** N/A. No secrets are involved in this feature.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** N/A. No new dependencies were added.
*   **Notes:** All applicable security checks pass.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** N/A. Logging for this feature is limited to client-side errors, which are not structured by default.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** The key event (API call) is implicitly logged via the browser's developer tools network tab. No custom logging is required for this event.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Verified that the `catchError` block in `contract-search.ts` uses `console.error` to log the full technical error object when an API call fails. This provides sufficient detail for debugging.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A. This is a client-side feature and does not generate correlation IDs.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A. No performance metrics are being captured for this feature at this time.
*   **Notes:** Observability requirements are met through existing error handling and browser diagnostics.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Verified that `contract-search.spec.ts` and `contract-filter-resolver.spec.ts` contain specific tests for the `type` parameter logic.
*   [x] **Integration Tests:** A gap was identified where the UI interaction for the filter dropdown was not tested. A new test case was added to `contract-browse-page.spec.ts` to simulate a `change` event on the `<select>` element and verify that `updateFilters` is called correctly.
*   [x] **Test Coverage:** With the addition of the new integration test, all logic paths for the filtering feature are now covered. All 46 tests pass.
*   [x] **Test Data Management:** Verified that mock data used in tests is self-contained and does not rely on external services.
*   **Notes:** Testability is fully addressed and verified.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Verified in `contract-browse-page.html` that the `<select>` element is correctly paired with a `<label for="contract-type">`.
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** Verified that the `<select>` element includes a descriptive `aria-label="Filter by contract type"` for screen readers.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** Confirmed that the native HTML `<select>` element is used, ensuring default keyboard navigability (tab to focus, arrow keys to change selection).
*   [x] **Color Contrast:** N/A. This feature uses default browser styling for the select box and does not introduce new colors.
*   [x] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Verified by inspection that standard, semantic HTML is used, ensuring compatibility with common screen readers.
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A. No images are part of this feature.
*   **Notes:** All accessibility requirements are met.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [x] **Text Abstraction:** Verified in `contract-browse-page.html` that the `<label>` and all `<option>` elements within the filter dropdown have been marked with the `i18n` attribute.
*   [x] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** N/A. The filter values (`item_exchange`, `auction`) are programmatic keys and not subject to locale formatting.
*   [x] **UI Layout Adaptability:** N/A. The simple dropdown control is not expected to cause layout issues with different text lengths.
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** N/A. The project's default UTF-8 encoding handles all text.
*   **Notes:** All i18n requirements are met.
