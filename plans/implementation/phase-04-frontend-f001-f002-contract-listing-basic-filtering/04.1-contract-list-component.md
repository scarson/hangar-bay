# Task 04.1: Contract Browsing Page (List & Filters)

## 1. Objective

This task is to develop the primary user-facing feature of Hangar Bay: a modern, unified, and interactive **Contract Browsing Page**. This involves building a single, cohesive Angular component that fetches and displays a list of public contracts, provides a comprehensive set of filtering and sorting options, and manages its state reactively using a centralized, signal-based service. The implementation must align with the architectural principles established in Phase 3.

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. State Management (Service)

*   [x] **Step 1.1:** Define frontend data models in `src/app/features/contracts/contract.models.ts`. These TypeScript interfaces must precisely match the Pydantic schemas found in the backend's `schemas/contracts.py`.
    *   `ContractItem` (from `ContractItemSchema`)
    *   `Contract` (from `ContractSchema`)
    *   `PaginatedContractsResponse` (from `PaginatedContractResponse`)
*   [x] **Step 1.2:** Define a comprehensive, immutable filter interface (`ContractSearchFilters`) in the same models file. This interface must align with the query parameters defined in the backend's `api/contracts.py` endpoint (`list_public_contracts`).
    *   `page: number`
    *   `size: number`
    *   `search?: string`
*   [x] **Step 1.3:** Generate a new service for state management.
    *   **AI Prompt:** `ng generate service features/contracts/contract-search`
    *   **Convention:** Per `00-angular-architecture-overview.md`, manually rename the generated class from `ContractSearchService` to `ContractSearch`.
*   [x] **Step 1.4:** In `contract-search.service.ts`, implement the signal-based state logic.
    *   **State Shape:** The service will manage state using a private `writableSignal`. It will expose individual public, read-only signals for consumption, as defined in pattern `ANG-P-001`: `loading: Signal<boolean>`, `error: Signal<any | null>`, `data: Signal<PaginatedContractsResponse | null>`, and `filters: Signal<ContractSearchFilters>`.
    *   **State Transitions:** When a new API call is initiated, `isLoading` will be set to `true`, but the `data` property will preserve the stale data from the previous successful fetch. This prevents UI flicker.
    *   **Effects & Data Fetching:** Replace the simple `effect()` with a more robust RxJS pipeline. Use Angular's `toObservable()` to convert the filter signal to an observable, then pipe it through `debounceTime(300)` and `switchMap()` to make the actual API call. This prevents race conditions.
    *   **Methods:** Public methods like `updateFilters(newFilters: Partial<ContractSearchFilters>)` and `setInitialFilters(initialFilters: ContractSearchFilters)` will update the state signal atomically.
*   [x] **Step 1.5:** Implement an Angular Route Resolver to handle initial state.
    *   **AI Prompt:** `ng generate resolver features/contracts/contract-filter`
    *   **Logic:** The resolver will parse the URL query parameters (`ActivatedRouteSnapshot.queryParams`) and return a `ContractSearchFilters` object.
    *   **Routing:** The resolver will be added to the `contract-browse-page` route definition, ensuring it runs before the component is activated. The `ContractSearchService` will be initialized with the data from this resolver.

### 3.2. UI (Component)

*   [x] **Step 2.1:** Generate a single, standalone container component.
    *   **AI Prompt:** `ng generate component features/contracts/contract-browse-page`
    *   **Convention:** Per `00-angular-architecture-overview.md`, manually rename the generated files (`*.component.ts` -> `*.ts`, etc.) and the class (`ContractBrowsePageComponent` -> `ContractBrowsePage`).
*   [x] **Step 2.2:** In the component, inject the `ContractSearchService` to connect the view to the state.
*   [x] **Step 2.3:** Build the view template (`contract-browse-page.html`).
    *   **Filter Panel:** Create UI controls for all filters specified in F002. Bind their values and events to the methods on the `ContractSearchService`.
    *   **Results List/Table:** Display the contract data. Use the individual `loading`, `error`, and `data` signals from the service to show the correct state in the template, as shown in pattern `ANG-P-001`.
    *   **Pagination Controls:** Create UI elements for pagination, bound to the service.
*   [x] **Step 2.4:** Apply SCSS styling for a clean, responsive, and usable interface, ensuring loading and empty/error states are handled gracefully.
*   [x] **Step 2.5:** Create the feature's route definition file.
    *   **Logic:** In `features/contracts/contracts.routes.ts`, define a `Route[]` array following pattern `ANG-P-003`. Add a route for the `ContractBrowsePage` that includes the `contractFilter` resolver from Step 1.5. This file will be lazy-loaded by the main application router in a subsequent task.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   **Architectural Mandate:** All components MUST be `standalone`. State MUST be managed centrally via the injectable, signal-based `ContractSearchService`. Components will react to state changes from the service, not communicate directly.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Adhere strictly to the naming conventions in `00-angular-architecture-overview.md`. This includes removing `Service` and `Component` suffixes from class names.
*   **Performance:** For rendering the list of contracts, the new built-in `@for` control flow MUST be used with a `track` function (e.g., `track contract.id`) to ensure optimal rendering performance.
*   **UI Library:** A decision on a UI component library (e.g., Angular Material) is pending. For now, implementation will proceed with basic, styleable HTML elements.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The service handles ALL state and logic. The component is responsible ONLY for presentation and delegating user events to the service.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [x] `ContractSearchService` is implemented and correctly manages feature state using signals.
*   [x] `ContractBrowsePage` component is implemented, standalone, and correctly associated with its route.
*   [x] The UI displays a list of contracts, which reactively updates based on changes to filters and pagination.
*   [x] The component correctly displays loading, data, and error states, and gracefully handles transitions between them without UI flicker.
*   [x] All filter options specified in F002 are implemented and functional.
*   [x] The feature is styled and responsive.
*   [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration tests are written for the service and component, achieving >90% coverage.
*   [ ] All items in the 'Cross-Cutting Concerns Review' section are addressed and checked off.
*   [x] All new code is committed to the feature branch.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   **Challenge:** The Angular linter initially reported a false positive error (`Property 'setInitialFilters' does not exist`) because it analyzed the resolver file before the service file was fully updated in its index.
*   **Resolution:** Verified the code in `contract-search.ts` was correct. The linting error resolved itself once the linter caught up with the file changes. No code change was needed.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** Verified. This is a public, read-only feature. No secrets are handled client-side.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** Verified. The `search` parameter is treated as data and sent to the backend, which is responsible for validation. No client-side logic depends on its structure.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** Verified. The template uses standard Angular interpolation (`{{...}}`), which provides automatic XSS protection. No `[innerHTML]` bindings are used.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. Public feature.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** N/A. No client-side secrets.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** Verified. `npm audit` was run and found 0 vulnerabilities.
*   **Notes:** This is a public-facing, read-only feature. 


### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** N/A for MVP.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** N/A for MVP.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** Verified. The `ContractSearch` service's `catchError` block logs the full error object to the console, providing sufficient detail for developer debugging.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A. Backend responsibility.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A for MVP.
*   **Notes:** For the MVP, client-side observability is focused on capturing errors for developer debugging in the browser console. Future integration with a remote logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) can be added. Correlation IDs would be a backend responsibility.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** `ContractSearchService` must be tested in isolation, mocking the `ContractApi`. Test state transitions, the RxJS pipeline (using marble testing), and all public methods thoroughly. The `ContractFilterResolver` must also be unit tested.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** `ContractBrowsePage` will be tested with a mocked `ContractSearchService` to verify that the template correctly reflects all possible states from the service's signals.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** Aim for >90% statement coverage for all new services, components, and resolvers.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** [ ]
*   **Notes:** Adhere to the patterns in `design/angular/guides/09-testing-strategies.md`. Test data will be managed via mock objects/files stored alongside the test files. The RxJS pipeline in the service should be tested with marble testing. All async tests must follow the zoneless pattern (use `async/await` with `fixture.whenStable()`, not `fakeAsync/tick`).

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [x] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Verified. The template uses `<h1>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` elements correctly.
*   [x] **ARIA Attributes:** Verified. `aria-live="polite"` has been added to the results container. All interactive controls have `aria-label` attributes.
*   [x] **Keyboard Navigability:** Verified. All interactive elements are native HTML controls and are keyboard navigable by default.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** Manual verification pending. The current default styles appear to have sufficient contrast, but this requires a formal check.
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Manual verification pending with NVDA/VoiceOver.
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A. No images are used.
*   **Notes:** A manual accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, check with NVDA or VoiceOver) is required before marking this task as done. No images are planned for this feature, so alt text is not applicable.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [x] **Text Abstraction:** Verified. All static user-facing text in the template has been marked with the `i18n` attribute.
*   [x] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** Verified. The template now uses `DatePipe` for dates and `DecimalPipe` for `price` and `volume`.
*   [x] **UI Layout Adaptability:** Verified. The component uses a flexbox-based layout which is adaptable to text length changes.
*   [x] **Character Encoding:** Verified. Default project setup is UTF-8.
*   **Notes:** Adhering to `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`, this task establishes the i18n-first pattern for all future UI development by marking all text in the initial layout components.
