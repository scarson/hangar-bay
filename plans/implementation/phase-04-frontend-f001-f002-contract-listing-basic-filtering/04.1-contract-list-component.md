# Task 04.1: Contract Browsing Page (List & Filters)

## 1. Objective

This task is to develop the primary user-facing feature of Hangar Bay: a modern, unified, and interactive **Contract Browsing Page**. This involves building a single, cohesive Angular component that fetches and displays a list of public contracts, provides a comprehensive set of filtering and sorting options, and manages its state reactively using a centralized, signal-based service. The implementation must align with the architectural principles established in Phase 3.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   **Official Pre-Mortem:** [Phase 04 Frontend (F001/F002) - Contract Listing & Filtering](../../../design/reviews/pre-mortems/phase-04-phase-four-frontend-pre-mortem.md)
*   **Backend API Contract:** `/design/api/openapi.yaml`
*   **Feature Specs:**
    *   `/design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md`
    *   `/design/features/F002-Ship-Browsing-Advanced-Search-Filtering.md`
*   **Core Angular Design Guides:**

    *   `/design/angular/guides/09-testing-strategies.md`

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. State Management (Service)

*   [ ] **Step 1.1:** Define frontend data models in `features/contracts/contract.models.ts` that precisely match the backend API contract (`openapi.yaml`). This includes interfaces like `Contract`, `PaginationInfo`, and `PaginatedContractsResponse`.
*   [ ] **Step 1.2:** Define a comprehensive, immutable filter interface (`ContractSearchFilters`) in the same models file. This ensures all filter updates are atomic.
*   [ ] **Step 1.3:** Generate a new service for state management.
    *   **AI Prompt:** `ng generate service features/contracts/contract-search`
    *   **Convention:** Per `00-angular-architecture-overview.md`, manually rename the generated class from `ContractSearchService` to `ContractSearch`.
*   [ ] **Step 1.4:** In `contract-search.service.ts`, implement the signal-based state logic.
    *   **State Shape:** The service will manage state using a private `writableSignal`. It will expose individual public, read-only signals for consumption, as defined in pattern `ANG-P-001`: `loading: Signal<boolean>`, `error: Signal<any | null>`, `data: Signal<PaginatedContractsResponse | null>`, and `filters: Signal<ContractSearchFilters>`.
    *   **State Transitions:** When a new API call is initiated, `isLoading` will be set to `true`, but the `data` property will preserve the stale data from the previous successful fetch. This prevents UI flicker.
    *   **Effects & Data Fetching:** Replace the simple `effect()` with a more robust RxJS pipeline. Use Angular's `toObservable()` to convert the filter signal to an observable, then pipe it through `debounceTime(300)` and `switchMap()` to make the actual API call. This prevents race conditions.
    *   **Methods:** Public methods like `updateFilters(newFilters: Partial<ContractSearchFilters>)` and `setInitialFilters(initialFilters: ContractSearchFilters)` will update the state signal atomically.
*   [ ] **Step 1.5:** Implement an Angular Route Resolver to handle initial state.
    *   **AI Prompt:** `ng generate resolver features/contracts/contract-filter`
    *   **Logic:** The resolver will parse the URL query parameters (`ActivatedRouteSnapshot.queryParams`) and return a `ContractSearchFilters` object.
    *   **Routing:** The resolver will be added to the `contract-browse-page` route definition, ensuring it runs before the component is activated. The `ContractSearchService` will be initialized with the data from this resolver.

### 3.2. UI (Component)

*   [ ] **Step 2.1:** Generate a single, standalone container component.
    *   **AI Prompt:** `ng generate component features/contracts/contract-browse-page`
    *   **Convention:** Per `00-angular-architecture-overview.md`, manually rename the generated files (`*.component.ts` -> `*.ts`, etc.) and the class (`ContractBrowsePageComponent` -> `ContractBrowsePage`).
*   [ ] **Step 2.2:** In the component, inject the `ContractSearchService` to connect the view to the state.
*   [ ] **Step 2.3:** Build the view template (`contract-browse-page.html`).
    *   **Filter Panel:** Create UI controls for all filters specified in F002. Bind their values and events to the methods on the `ContractSearchService`.
    *   **Results List/Table:** Display the contract data. Use the individual `loading`, `error`, and `data` signals from the service to show the correct state in the template, as shown in pattern `ANG-P-001`.
    *   **Pagination Controls:** Create UI elements for pagination, bound to the service.
*   [ ] **Step 2.4:** Apply SCSS styling for a clean, responsive, and usable interface, ensuring loading and empty/error states are handled gracefully.
*   [ ] **Step 2.5:** Create the feature's route definition file.
    *   **Logic:** In `features/contracts/contracts.routes.ts`, define a `Route[]` array following pattern `ANG-P-003`. Add a route for the `ContractBrowsePage` that includes the `contractFilter` resolver from Step 1.5. This file will be lazy-loaded by the main application router in a subsequent task.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   **Architectural Mandate:** All components MUST be `standalone`. State MUST be managed centrally via the injectable, signal-based `ContractSearchService`. Components will react to state changes from the service, not communicate directly.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Adhere strictly to the naming conventions in `00-angular-architecture-overview.md`. This includes removing `Service` and `Component` suffixes from class names.
*   **Performance:** For rendering the list of contracts, the new built-in `@for` control flow MUST be used with a `track` function (e.g., `track contract.id`) to ensure optimal rendering performance.
*   **UI Library:** A decision on a UI component library (e.g., Angular Material) is pending. For now, implementation will proceed with basic, styleable HTML elements.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The service handles ALL state and logic. The component is responsible ONLY for presentation and delegating user events to the service.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** Not applicable as this task implements a pre-defined design for a public, unauthenticated feature. The frontend does not handle secrets.
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** The primary security burden lies on the backend to sanitize and validate all query parameters.
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** Angular provides default protection against XSS. Verify no manual `innerHTML` bindings are used with unsanitized data.
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** Not applicable as this task implements a pre-defined design for a public, unauthenticated feature. The frontend does not handle secrets.
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** N/A
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** A dependency scan (`npm audit`) will be run before marking the task as complete.
*   **Notes:** This is a public-facing, read-only feature. 


### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** N/A
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** N/A
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** Frontend will log any failed API requests (e.g., network errors, 5xx responses) to the browser console with structured error objects.
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** N/A
*   [ ] **Metrics:** N/A
*   **Notes:** For the MVP, client-side observability is focused on capturing errors for developer debugging in the browser console. Future integration with a remote logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) can be added. Correlation IDs would be a backend responsibility.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** `ContractSearchService` must be tested in isolation, mocking the `ContractApi`. Test state transitions, the RxJS pipeline (using marble testing), and all public methods thoroughly. The `ContractFilterResolver` must also be unit tested.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** `ContractBrowsePage` will be tested with a mocked `ContractSearchService` to verify that the template correctly reflects all possible states from the service's signals.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** Aim for >90% statement coverage for all new services, components, and resolvers.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** [ ]
*   **Notes:** Adhere to the patterns in `design/angular/guides/09-testing-strategies.md`. Test data will be managed via mock objects/files stored alongside the test files. The RxJS pipeline in the service should be tested with marble testing. All async tests must follow the zoneless pattern (use `async/await` with `fixture.whenStable()`, not `fakeAsync/tick`).

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** Use appropriate tags for filter forms (`<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`), tables/lists, and buttons.
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** Use `aria-live="polite"` for the results region to announce updates. Ensure all form controls have associated `<label>`s.
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** All interactive elements (filters, buttons, links, sort headers) must be focusable and operable via keyboard in a logical order.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** Ensure all text and UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast ratios.
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** [ ]
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A
*   **Notes:** A manual accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, check with NVDA or VoiceOver) is required before marking this task as done. No images are planned for this feature, so alt text is not applicable.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** All static text in the template (labels, buttons, headers, placeholder text) must be marked with the `i18n` attribute.
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** Use Angular's `DatePipe` and `DecimalPipe` to format `date_expired` and `price` fields in the contract list.
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** Use flexible CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid) to ensure the UI adapts to text expansion from different languages.
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** Character encoding (UTF-8) is handled by the default project setup and is not a task-specific concern.
*   **Notes:** Adhering to `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`, this task establishes the i18n-first pattern for all future UI development by marking all text in the initial layout components.
