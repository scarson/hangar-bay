# Task 04.1: Contract List Component

**Phase:** 04 - Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Objective

To develop an Angular component that fetches and displays a list of public contracts from the backend API. This includes displaying key contract details in a tabular or card-based format and implementing basic pagination.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `/design/features/F001-Public-Ship-Contract-Browsing.md` (Defines what contract data to show)
*   `/design/specifications/design-spec.md` (Sections: UI/UX Principles, Frontend Architecture)
*   `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md` (Guidelines for accessible data display)
*   Task 03.2: Backend API Service Layer (Service to fetch contract data)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Backend API providing the data)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Generate Contract List Component:**
    *   Use Angular CLI: `ng generate component features/contract-browsing/contract-list --flat` (the `--flat` option creates the component files directly in the given path without an additional subdirectory, suitable if this is the main view component for this path segment; omit `--flat` if a dedicated subdirectory `contract-list` is preferred).
    *   This `ContractListComponent` will be the primary component associated with the `/browse-contracts` route, replacing the `BrowseContractsPageComponent` placeholder that was defined in Task 03.3 (`basic-layout-routing.md`). It will be responsible for fetching and displaying the list of contracts.
*   [ ] **Integrate API Service:**
    *   Inject the API service (from Task 03.2) into the `ContractListComponent`.
    *   Call the service method `getShipContracts(params?: ShipContractsRequestParams)` (from Task 03.2) in `ngOnInit` or in response to filter/pagination changes.
    *   Handle the `Observable` response (e.g., using `async` pipe in template or subscribing in component).
*   [ ] **Define Data Display Structure:**
    *   Decide on a display format (table, list of cards, etc.).
    *   Identify key ship contract fields to display as per F001 and the `ShipContract` interface (from Task 03.2, e.g., `ship_name`, `price`, `start_location_name`, `date_expired`, `title`, `is_blueprint_copy`, `runs`).
    *   Create the HTML template to render the list of ship contracts.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate an Angular component template (`.html`) that displays a list of `ShipContract` objects (interface defined in Task 03.2). Each contract has fields like `ship_name`, `price`, `start_location_name`, `date_expired`, `title`, `is_blueprint_copy`, `runs`, `issuer_name`. Display these in a responsive table (e.g., using basic HTML `<table>` or Angular Material `MatTable`). Include columns for these key fields. Ensure dates are formatted readably (e.g., using Angular's `DatePipe`)."
*   [ ] **Implement Basic Pagination:**
    *   The backend API (`GET /api/v1/contracts/ships` from Task 02.4, called by `getShipContracts` service method from Task 03.2) supports server-driven pagination via `page` and `size` parameters and returns `total`, `page`, `size`, and `pages` in the `PaginatedShipContractsResponse`.
    *   Add UI elements for pagination (e.g., "Next", "Previous" buttons, page number display/input, items per page selector). Angular Material's `MatPaginator` is a good option if Material is used.
    *   Update the call to `getShipContracts` to pass the current `page` and `size` from the component's state.
    *   Manage pagination state in the component (current page, page size, total items) based on the API response.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to implement pagination controls in an Angular component. The component calls a service method `getShipContracts(params: ShipContractsRequestParams)` which returns an `Observable<PaginatedShipContractsResponse>`. The response includes `items`, `total`, `page`, `size`, and `pages`.
        - The component should maintain `currentPage` and `pageSize` state.
        - Implement methods to go to the next/previous page and to change page size.
        - These methods should re-fetch data by calling `getShipContracts` with updated `params`.
        - The template should display pagination info (e.g., 'Page X of Y', 'Items A-B of C') and provide controls (buttons, dropdown for page size). Consider using Angular Material's `MatPaginator` if applicable, otherwise basic HTML controls."
*   [ ] **Styling:**
    *   Apply basic SCSS styling for readability and presentation.
*   [ ] **Loading and Empty States:**
    *   Implement UI indicators for when data is loading.
    *   Display a message if no contracts are found or an error occurs.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Use Angular's `*ngFor` to iterate over contract data.
*   Consider using Angular Material components (e.g., `MatTable`, `MatPaginator`) for a richer UI, if Material is part of the project.
*   Ensure data is displayed in a user-friendly and accessible manner.
*   Handle potential `null` or `undefined` values gracefully in the template.

## 5. Definition of Done

*   The `ContractListComponent` is created and is configured in the routing module (as per Task 03.3 `basic-layout-routing.md`) to be the component that handles the `/browse-contracts` route, thereby replacing the temporary `BrowseContractsPageComponent` placeholder.
*   The component fetches and displays a list of contracts from the backend.
*   Key contract details are visible.
*   Basic pagination functionality is implemented.
*   Loading and empty/error states are handled.
*   Component is styled for basic usability.
*   All new files and code changes are committed to version control.
