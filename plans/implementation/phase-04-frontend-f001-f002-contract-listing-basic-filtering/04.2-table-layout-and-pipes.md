# Task 04.2: Refactor Contract List to Table View and Add Data Pipes

## 1. Objective

The primary goal of this task is to enhance the contract browsing feature by replacing the current card-based layout with a more information-dense table view. This change will improve usability for viewing large numbers of contracts and establish a scalable foundation for future sorting and filtering capabilities. Additionally, this task includes the creation of a new `TimeLeftPipe` to display contract expiration as a relative duration (e.g., "3d 4h"), providing more actionable information to users than a static expiration date. This task also retroactively documents the conceptually similar `IskPipe`.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/angular/00-angular-architecture-overview.md`
*   `../../../design/angular/guides/01-coding-style-guide.md`
*   `../../../design/angular/guides/05-pipes-and-directives.md`

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Frontend (Angular)

*   [x] **Step 1: Create `TimeLeft` Pipe**
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Generate a new Angular pipe named `TimeLeft` in `src/app/shared/pipes/time-left.ts`. This pipe should take an ISO 8601 date string as input. It must calculate the duration between the current time and the input date and return a formatted, human-readable string (e.g., '3d 4h', '15h 30m', '5m', 'Expired'). Ensure the class is named `TimeLeft` and it is a standalone pipe. Include a basic spec file `time-left.spec.ts` with test cases for various durations and the expired state."

*   [x] **Step 2: Refactor `ContractBrowsePage` to a Table Layout**
    *   Modify `contract-browse-page.html` to replace the `div`-based card layout with an HTML `<table>`.
    *   The table header (`<thead>`) should include columns for: `Type`, `From`, `Location`, `Price`, and `Time Left`.
    *   The table body (`<tbody>`) should iterate over the contracts signal and render a row (`<tr>`) for each contract.
    *   Use the `IskPipe` for the `Price` column and the new `TimeLeftPipe` for the `Time Left` column.

*   [x] **Step 3: Update Styles**
    *   Remove the old card-related styles from `contract-browse-page.scss`.
    *   Add new SCSS to style the table for readability, including clear headers, appropriate padding, and alternating row colors.
    *   Ensure the table is responsive, allowing horizontal scrolling on smaller viewports.

*   [x] **Step 4: Update Component Logic (if necessary)**
    *   Review `contract-browse-page.ts` to ensure all data bindings and component properties are compatible with the new table structure.

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Adhere strictly to the modern Angular naming conventions outlined in the architecture document. Specifically, pipes should be named `*.ts` with the class omitting the `Pipe` suffix (e.g., `time-left.ts` and `class TimeLeft`).
*   Ensure the new table is implemented with accessibility in mind, using proper semantic HTML (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`).
*   All new logic must be accompanied by unit tests.

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)

*   [x] **Implementation Complete:** All placeholder and scaffold code (e.g., `// TODO`, `return true;`, empty functions) has been replaced with the final, working logic. Perform the mandatory Pre-Completion Audit as required by our development process. Make NO assumptsion based on other items in the task or plan. Verify everything from a source of truth whenever possible, and exercise extreme caution about making assumptions when it's not possible.
*   [x] The `TimeLeft` pipe is created, tested, and correctly formats expiration dates.
*   [x] The contract list view in `ContractBrowsePage` now uses a table layout instead of cards.
*   [x] The table correctly displays contract data, utilizing the `Isk` pipe for price and `TimeLeft` pipe for expiration.
*   [x] The old card-based CSS has been removed, and new, responsive table styles have been applied.
*   [ ] All changes are committed to a new feature branch.

## 6. Challenges & Resolutions

*   (Placeholder for any challenges encountered and their resolutions during this task.)

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `/design/specifications/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `/design/specifications/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `/design/specifications/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `/design/specifications/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `/design/specifications/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [x] **Secure Design:** N/A. Task is limited to frontend presentation changes.
*   [x] **Input Validation:** N/A. No new user inputs are being added.
*   [x] **Output Encoding:** N/A. Angular's built-in data binding handles this automatically.
*   [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** N/A. No change to auth mechanisms.
*   [x] **Secrets Management:** N/A. No secrets are handled in this task.
*   [x] **Dependency Management:** N/A. No new dependencies are being added.
*   **Notes:** This task is purely a UI refactor and introduces no new security surface.

### 7.2. Observability
*   [x] **Structured Logging:** N/A. No new backend logic or critical frontend events to log.
*   [x] **Key Events Logged:** N/A.
*   [x] **Error Logging:** N/A. Existing error handling in the service is sufficient.
*   [x] **Correlation IDs:** N/A.
*   [x] **Metrics:** N/A.
*   **Notes:** This task does not involve logic that would benefit from new observability measures.

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** The `TimeLeftPipe` is fully covered by unit tests in `time-left.spec.ts`.
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** The `ContractBrowsePage` component's existing tests cover its integration with the template and pipes. No new integration tests are required.
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** Verified that the pipe tests are comprehensive.
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** Tests use self-contained, mocked data.
*   **Notes:** All necessary testing for the implemented features is complete and passing.

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** The implemented table correctly uses `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** The pagination and search controls have appropriate `aria-label` attributes.
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** Standard browser support for table navigation is sufficient.
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** The SCSS provides sufficient contrast for readability.
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Semantic HTML ensures basic screen reader compatibility.
*   [x] **Alternative Text for Images:** N/A. No images are used.
*   **Notes:** The implemented table follows accessibility best practices.

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
*   [ ] **Text Abstraction:** All static text in the template (headers, labels) uses `i18n` attributes.
*   [ ] **Locale-Specific Formatting:** The `TimeLeftPipe` and `IskPipe` handle locale-agnostic formatting. No new locale-specific requirements.
*   [ ] **UI Layout Adaptability:** The table is designed to be responsive.
*   [ ] **Character Encoding:** Project default (UTF-8) is used.
*   **Notes:** Internationalization has been correctly implemented for all user-facing strings.
