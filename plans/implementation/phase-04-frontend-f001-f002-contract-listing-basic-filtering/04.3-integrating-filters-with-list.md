# Task 04.3: Integrating Basic Filters with Contract List

**Phase:** 04 - Frontend - F001/F002: Contract Listing & Basic Filtering
**Parent Plan:** [MVP Implementation Plan Overview](../00-mvp-implementation-plan-overview.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-07 <!-- To be updated by AI/USER -->

## 1. Objective

To integrate the basic filtering UI (contract type and region filters developed in Task 04.2) with the `ContractListComponent` (developed in Task 04.1). This involves capturing filter changes, updating the API request parameters, and refreshing the contract list display.

## 2. Relevant Specifications

*   `../../../design/features/F001-Public-Contract-Aggregation-Display.md` (Defines filterable fields)
*   `../../../design/design-spec.md` (UI/UX Principles for interactive elements)
*   Task 04.1: Contract List Component (`04.1-contract-list-component.md`)
*   Task 04.2: Basic Filtering UI (`04.2-basic-filtering-ui.md`)
*   Task 03.2: Backend API Service Layer (Service used to fetch contracts, needs to accept filter params)
*   Task 02.4: API Endpoints for F001 (Backend API supporting filter parameters)

## 3. Key Implementation Steps

*   [ ] **Modify `ContractListComponent`:**
    *   Update the component to receive filter change events or values from the `BasicFilteringUIComponent` (Task 04.2). This could be via `@Input()` properties if the filter UI is a child, or through a shared service, or component events (`@Output()`).
    *   Store current filter values within the `ContractListComponent`.
*   [ ] **Update API Call Logic:**
    *   Modify the `fetchContracts` (or similar) method in `ContractListComponent` (and potentially in the `ContractApiService`) to include selected filter parameters (contract type, region ID) in the API request to `/api/v1/contracts/ships`.
    *   Ensure pagination is reset or handled correctly when filters are applied (e.g., return to page 1).
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Show how to modify an Angular component method that fetches paginated data to include optional filter parameters (e.g., `contractType?: string`, `regionId?: number`) and reset pagination to the first page when filters change."
*   [ ] **Trigger Data Refresh:**
    *   When a filter value changes (e.g., user selects a new region), trigger a re-fetch of the contract list with the new filter criteria.
    *   Provide visual feedback if necessary (e.g., loading indicator).
*   [ ] **Integrate Filter Component:**
    *   Ensure the `BasicFilteringUIComponent` (from Task 04.2) is correctly placed in the template of the page/component that hosts the `ContractListComponent` (likely the `BrowseContractsPageComponent` or its successor).
    *   Establish communication between the filter UI component and the contract list component.
    *   **AI Prompt:** "Illustrate how an Angular parent component can host a filter child component and a list child component, where changes in the filter component trigger an update in the list component. Show event emission (`@Output()`) from the filter component and handling in the parent, which then passes data to the list component (`@Input()`) or calls a method on it."

## 4. AI Implementation Guidance

*   Focus on clear data flow: Filter UI emits changes -> Parent/Container component receives changes -> Parent/Container updates List component's inputs or calls its methods -> List component re-fetches data with new filters.
*   Use Angular's reactive forms or template-driven forms for managing filter inputs if not already robustly handled in 04.2.
*   Ensure that the API service layer (Task 03.2) correctly constructs the HTTP request with the filter query parameters. The backend (Task 02.4) should be capable of handling these.
*   Consider debouncing filter inputs if they trigger API calls directly on every keystroke (though for select dropdowns, this is less of an issue).

## 5. Definition of Done

*   Changes in the basic filter UI (contract type, region) trigger an update to the displayed contract list.
*   The `ContractApiService` is correctly called with the new filter parameters.
*   Pagination is reset to the first page when filters are applied.
*   The UI updates to reflect the filtered contract data.
*   The integration is seamless and user-friendly.
*   All new and modified code is committed to version control.

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns Review

This section documents how the five key cross-cutting concerns were addressed during the completion of this task. Refer to the primary specification documents for detailed guidance:
*   Security: `../../../../design/security-spec.md`
*   Observability: `../../../../design/observability-spec.md`
*   Testing: `../../../../design/test-spec.md`
*   Accessibility: `../../../../design/accessibility-spec.md`
*   Internationalization (i18n): `../../../../design/i18n-spec.md`

### 7.1. Security
*   [ ] **Secure Design:** (e.g., threat modeling, principle of least privilege)
*   [ ] **Input Validation:** (e.g., validating all external inputs)
*   [ ] **Output Encoding:** (e.g., preventing XSS)
*   [ ] **Authentication/Authorization:** (e.g., ensuring proper checks)
*   [ ] **Secrets Management:** (e.g., secure storage and access)
*   [ ] **Dependency Management:** (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if a category is not applicable to this task.)

### 7.2. Observability
*   [ ] **Structured Logging:** (e.g., using key-value pairs, JSON format)
*   [ ] **Key Events Logged:** (e.g., task initiation, completion, critical errors, significant state changes)
*   [ ] **Error Logging:** (e.g., comprehensive error details, stack traces)
*   [ ] **Correlation IDs:** (e.g., for tracing requests across services)
*   [ ] **Metrics:** (e.g., performance indicators, resource usage - if applicable)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 7.3. Testing
*   [ ] **Unit Tests:** (e.g., for new functions, classes, components)
*   [ ] **Integration Tests:** (e.g., for interactions between components/services)
*   [ ] **Test Coverage:** (e.g., summary of coverage achieved or targeted)
*   [ ] **Test Data Management:** (e.g., how test data is sourced/managed)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action.)

### 7.4. Accessibility (A11y)
*(Primarily for UI-related tasks, but consider CLI/API accessibility where relevant)*
*   [ ] **Semantic HTML/Structure:** (e.g., using appropriate tags for meaning)
*   [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** (e.g., for dynamic content or custom controls)
*   [ ] **Keyboard Navigability:** (e.g., all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard)
*   [ ] **Color Contrast:** (e.g., ensuring sufficient contrast for text and UI elements)
*   [ ] **Screen Reader Compatibility:** (e.g., testing with screen readers)
*   [ ] **Alternative Text for Images:** (e.g., providing descriptive alt text)
*   **Notes:** (Detail specific actions taken or rationale for no action, especially if not UI-related.)

### 7.5. Internationalization (I18n)
